I was far from proposing multi-trigger solution here.
Just wanted to highlight that with trigger approach there is
a trade-off problem.

Triggers are not limited to periodic blinking or reporting cpu
activity. There is also oneshot trigger that can be used e.g. when
user touches the screen, as Pali mentioned.

I'd say this is the trigger approach which is a bit convoluted.
