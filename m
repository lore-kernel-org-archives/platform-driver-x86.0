They are more consistent with PNP ids then with their DMI strings, that is if they
re-use the exact same touchpad the PNP id stays the same. So PNP ids give us a
better chance of things just working without the user needing to wait for a distro
update which has the new DMI strings in there.

And yes so far the PNP ids use we want to-do is Lenovo only, as we've just discovered
that they are actually storing some useful info in there. If we need quirks for other
vendor laptops in the future, chances are we may want to do pnp-id matching there too.

I've deliberately tried to write this patch-set so that it adds a generic way to export
extra info the platform specific code may have. I could have added a pnp-id pointer to
the serio struct, but I deliberately went with a free-form string so as to make this
as generic as possible. As Matthew has already said we may want to also export extra
info from devicetree through this mechanism for example.

Hans
