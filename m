TCO driver is anyway auto-loaded by mfd driver lpc_ich as a sub-functio=
n of it.

The aim of my patch is only to add warning interrupt support in TCO dri=
ver.
=46or this it need the GPE number which is exposed by Bios in acpi tabl=
es.
So the patch registers also the TCO driver as an acpi driver to be able=
 to retrieve this value.

The acpi code part is only required by the interrupt handling support, =
not needed for the loading of the driver itself (already done by lpc_ic=
h).

In this context I don't see the point of dissociating the driver part f=
rom the loading, unless the loading would need to be reverted later.

Thanks,

Unless I am missing something, you are making two changes in a single p=
atch.

- auto-load driver if acpi device is exposed by bios
- Add interrupt handling support

I suggested to separate those changes into two patches.
