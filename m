Thanks for the clarification. The wording is misleading then, in my
views at least, i2c_bus_type belongs to the i2c core, so "after i2c
core is initialized" would be enough.

I did not think of looking there, my bad. Indeed I see this is already
fixed, which is good.

That's better, but won't you still have to live with
silead_ts_dmi_notifier_call() and silead_ts_dmi_add_props() loaded
forever, and the notification hook enabled,  even if you don't have any
Silead touchscreen on your x86 system? I can't see how a
notification-based implementation could clean up everything, as you
supposedly don't know when you will be called (which is my main concern
about this implementation - you should be able to run the fixup code
once and be done with it.)

While this is a laudable goal, how will it scale in practice? I mean,
most drivers do need quirks in one form or another. Are we really going
to double the number of "drivers" (as in .c files and modules) and
Kconfig options to cleanly separate quirks from the device drivers
proper?

From my perspective, you are solving the problem that all users of a
driver shouldn't have to pay for platforms which did get things wrong,
but your solution causes all users of the platform to pay the overhead
instead. Which is statistically a much larger number of people. If we
are going to be unfair, we might as well go for the most simple
solution.

So I'm sorry but I can't see how your approach is better than just
ifdef'd platform-specific code in the device driver, as we have been
doing so far.

I have a hard time understanding how you did not come up with this idea
first, to be honest. If the problem you need to solve is caused by
missing data in the ACPI tables, injecting the missing data at the ACPI
level would seem to be the most straightforward way to go. Fixing the
problem as close as possible to its source. But I will admit I am not
familiar enough with the ACPI subsystem implementation to say if that
can be done today or if preparatory work is needed.

I'm speechless. If you believe that this kind of bug isn't worth fixing
quickly, I'll go disable that piece of cra^H^Hode from the opeSUSE
kernel for the time being. And then, go figure if/when anyone will
remember to re-enable it once it is in an acceptable state.

I thought the rule about upstream kernel code acceptance was that you
should get things right first, no matter how much time and how many
iterations it takes, and then we commit the result. Apparently this has
changed while I was not looking :-(
