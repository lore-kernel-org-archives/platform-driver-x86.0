From the power-profiles-daemon, and the GNOME UI side, we're unlikely
to expose those separate profiles as that's not how we envisioned the
profiles being used (there's an API to force a power-saving, or
performance profile temporarily, and the desktop implements power-
saving policies based upon that).

We have priors when it comes to specific profiles behaving slightly
differently depending on external factors, for example the performance
profile on some Intel Lenovo laptops being throttled down when a lap is
detected, or our attempt at using the "balance_power" intel pstate
preference when on battery (later reverted because this preference is
incredibly aggressive...).

I think that keeping the external API would be best for user-space,
we'd just want to have a way to know how it's behaving internally, eg.
exposing that it has separate profiles for AC and battery, and whether
an AC or battery variant is selected at this time.

Cheers
