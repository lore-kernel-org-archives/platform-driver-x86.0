On IBM ThinkPads, the "generates KEY_foo" thing is controlable by the
driver.  In fact, thinkpad_acpi defaults to NOT send these, all breakage
is entirely the fault of userspace that enables it instead of doing OSD
out of the extra mixer, and then fails to deal with the side-effects.

On Lenovo ThinkPads, it depends on BIOS/EC version for the X60/T60.  Later
versions will behave like the X61/T61. Since family 200 you can tell the
EC to switch modes (latch, toggle, none), but Lenovo didn't test it well
enough.

Like I said, we disable that by default, and userspace enables them back
because they want to use it as a keyboard.  We could override it entirely
on the IBM thinkpads, and refuse to issue any key events no matter what, I
suppose.

No, it doesn't.  Only after an exaustive search for what _OSI(Linux)
changes across a brickload of thinkpad ACPI dumps could we say that for
sure.

Yeah.

It is the EC, which also emulates the i8042 KBC.

I don't see any problems with the code, will have to test it in a IBM
thinkpad, though (I have one).
