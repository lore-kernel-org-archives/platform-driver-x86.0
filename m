Thank's for your information, I will look at it.

=46inally,
I borrow a Acer Aspire one ZG8 from Gary, it can reproduce your
situation.

The BAD thing is you are right,=20
I CAN REPRODUCE rfkill-input didn't receive any input, it not make sens=
e
because rfkill-input registered input handler.

The BT HW key still works because acer-wmi have polling to sync the
state with EC and killswitch, and EC also take care the BT device power
off job.

But, I also found SOMETIMES after system reboot, rfkill-input can
capture the key event.
We need find out why input handle didn't receive KEY_* event.


Hi, Dmitry=20

Appreciate if you can give us any good suggestions!
Why keyboard emit KEY_BLUETOOTH, but rfkill-input, registered input
handler, can't capture it?

*** 06:32:42.972: lshal: device_condition,
udi=3D/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/platform_i8042_i8042_KBD_port_logica=
ldev_input
           condition_name=3DButtonPressed
           condition_details=3Dbluetooth

But, SOMETIMES after reboot system, rfkill-input can capture the key.
We are working on 2.6.38 kernel, and Acer notebook.


Thank's a lot!
Joey Lee
