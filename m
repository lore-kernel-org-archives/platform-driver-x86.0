I'm wondering whether it's really worth it.  We already allow doing
darned near anything using dcdbas.  Maybe the world won't end if we
expose a complete-ish ioctl interface to WMI.

Also, dcdbas is, to put it mildly, a bit ridiculous.  It seems to be a
seriously awkward sysfs interface that allows you to, drumroll please,
issue outb and inb instructions.  It doesn't even check that it's
running on a Dell system.  It might be nice to deprecate it some day
in favor of a real interface.  I'd consider a low-level WMI ioctl
interface to be a vast improvement.
