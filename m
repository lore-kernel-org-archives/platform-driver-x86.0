Reading that stuff ain't cheap.  Either a locked trip through the LPC bus
for the CMOS nvram, or ACPI EC I/O (which is even worse, I fear.  That EC is
also hooked to LPC, and there's a lot more code involved).

I really would rather not enable it on boxes where it isn't required.  And
we know which ones are those: IBM thinkpads where the all-available-hotkeys
mask has the bits for the volume hotkeys set.

It would be very very useful, though.
