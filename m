Yes, POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_CHARGE_BEHAVIOUR was initially added for basically
the same settings on Lenovo ThinkPad laptops. Note these options are typically
used to implement battery "fuel-gauge" calibration functionality.

I guess inhibit charge could be used together with a userspace daemon
monitoring charge to implement a charge to 80% threshold. But that would be
a new way to use this API. Note I'm not saying it would be a wrong use,
just a new use.

Is there a WMI object which will call

when its control method is called with certain arguments ?  Typically
the answer to this will be yes, in which case you really should go
through that WMI object, so as to support more models where the
method names / args may be different.

That is a good question, if you can figure out how to access these methods
through some WMI object then doing so should be safe on any model with
that WMI object.  But firmware bugs do happen, so we may need some
heuristics on top of relying on the WMI object GUID.
