That risk is a perhaps a practical risk.

This is a theoretical risk LSMs wish to determine and based on information
assess what to do.

I mean that using memremap() or ioremap() will is designed to give
hardware access to memory for IO purposes, and how writes occur
will vary, and as such we cannot give LSMs guarantees over that
the firmware API will finish a write and that the data provided
really is correct.

LSMs have the option to trust the kernel, its about context and letting LSMs
decide. They have the right to not trust IO devices to a memory segment, as it
could break guarantees the kernel is making, so this is not about trust or
not, its about *information* and letting LSMs choose.

Its up to LSMs to implement the policy.

I gave this some though and this obviously is just as good as trying to just use
kmalloc() as that is what is desired, the issue however *ensuring* that the allocation
will succeed. The only thing that I can think of there is somehow hinting upon boot
to reserve a special allocation for later use. If not at boot, perhaps a hint to
eventually give back the desired contigious allocation, but its beyond me if any
of this is in fact possible.
