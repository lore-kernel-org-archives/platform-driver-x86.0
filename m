Apologies for the silence on my end. I've reviewed all the comments, and
my understanding is we are awaiting a v3 from Kai-Heng. Is that correct?

Mario and Pali, thank you for working through the heuristics of platform
identification. I appreciate taking the time to look at the big picture,
or the scale impacts ("what if everyone did this?") - that leads to
better solutions. Of course, this is the platform driver subsystem, and
part of why we exist is to cover the quirks of today's systems, so we
can't spend too much time on what-ifs. I think your conclusions were
reasonable.

So I'm waiting for v3 from Kai-Heng - unless I've misunderstood the
conclusion of this thread.
