Maybe we should return -EPROBE_DEFER in GPIO swnode lookup when
fwnode_property_get_reference_args() returns -ENOENT because if there's a
software node that's not yet been registered as a firmware node, it's not much
different from there being a firmware node not bound to a device yet - which
is grounds for probe deferral.

What I meant is: name matching is only one method of assigning software nodes
to devices. Here I went with waiting for devices but with DT we may as well
look up a node by compatible depending on the driver. For ACPI we may probably
use some mechanism that matches the devices to the software node in a more
specific way. That's just hypothetical, I don't know if there even is one.

IOW: device-name-to-software-node name matching is only one of possible methods.

Ok, I didn't fully get that part, I was OoO on Friday and should have probably
not rushed a late evening answer. :)

I still don't like it. It forces us to use names for the remote software nodes,
which are after all C structures that we could identify by addresses alone.
Even this series could be reworked to drop the names from the GPIO software
nodes.

software_node_find_by_name() only goes through the list of registered software
nodes so we'd still end up returning -ENOENT for nodes which have not been
registered yet and wouldn't be able to tell this situation apart from a case
where there's no such software node at all.

The consumer driver still needs to know the remote device by an arbitrary
string.

I think you're exaggarating the possible problems with link order. I believe
that issue could be fixed by returning EPROBE_DEFER when a software node is
not yet known by an fwnode handle but we know it is there so it's just a matter
of it getting registered.

That being said, I would like to hear from driver core maintainers in general
and from software node maintainers in particular.

That's dictated by the binary format of devicetree where:

	prop = <&foo>;

Is translated to:

	foo {
		phandle = <0x123>;
	};

	prop = <0x123>;

And I suppose this could be translated into addresses of respective struct
device_node objects already at the tree unflattening stage - just like is
done for parent-child relationships.

However, this is very much hidden from users and someone who deals with DT
sources always sees a proper reference to a node (by path, label or otherwise).

Here we're talking about referring to firmware nodes by name which does happen
but is typically reserved for some special cases and well-known nodes.
