Well, you can use git show -M01 and it will likely show what
changed. The thing is that plain diff is not very good showing
diffs on text files. I suspect that using some tool like wdiff
would give a better view of such changes.

Yes, for complex tables, one needs to draw rows/columns. For simple
tables, all you need to do is something like:

  ====== ========   ====    ========    ===
  -      CONT PTE    PMD    CONT PMD    PUD
  ====== ========   ====    ========    ===
  4K:         64K     2M         32M     1G
  16K:         2M    32M          1G
  64K:         2M   512M         16G
  ====== ========   ====    ========    ===

in order to teach Sphinx where each column starts/stops, and
(optionally) show the table titles in bold.

(that's from Documentation/arm64/hugetlbpage.rst conversion)

Yeah, one has to take the conversion effort, but once done, it should be
easy to keep it updated.

Font selection is one of the things would require some markup, as a
plain text file doesn't have font changes.

There are several ways to make it use a monospaced font.

The straight forward way would be to place everything that it is
monospaced inside ``double quotes``, with is the ReST way to mark
a literal block inside a text. IMHO, that would add too much
"noise" at the tables.

Another possibility would be to do:

	.. raw:: html

	       <head><style>td { font-family: monospace, monospace; }</style></head>

(the double monospace here is not a mistake - it is due to a known
bug^H^H^Hfeature on some browsers[1])

[1] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38781089/font-family-monospace-monospace

IMO, the best alternative would be to add a new class to the css file,
and use it whenever we need a table with monospaced font, e. g.:

diff --git a/Documentation/sphinx-static/theme_overrides.css b/Documentation/sphinx-static/theme_overrides.css

(patch on the top of this tree
https://git.linuxtv.org/mchehab/experimental.git/tree/Documentation/x86/x86_64/mm.rst?h=convert_rst_renames)

The ..cssclass:: markup on the above example will be applied just to
the table below it. So, with that, it is possible to have normal and
monospaced tables mixed (if you apply the above patch, you'll see
that just the first table will use monospaced fonts).

- 

Personally, I don't care much with monospaced fonts on this table. After
all, if I want to see it monospaced, I can simply click at the
"View page source" at the browser, and it will display the file as a
plain old monospaced text file.

Thanks,
Mauro
