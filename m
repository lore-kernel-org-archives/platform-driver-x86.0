The idea is sound, but it would be probably cleaner to do it only on those
thinkpads which need it.  I don't like the idea of handling duplicate
notifications, and the logic depends entirely on nothing messing with the
mixer state behind our backs, I'd prefer to rely on it just when strictly
required.

Also, UCMS is called for a number of reasons.  It would be best to filter
based on the UCMS parameter before doing an expensive PC CMOS RAM read or EC
read.  We will be dealing with a finite number of thinkpads anyway.

On the same note, we need to be called *after* the UCMS method completes,
otherwise, we will have to schedule delayed work.  I didn't study your ACPI
patch enough to know whether this happens, but that detail is not clear from
the description.
