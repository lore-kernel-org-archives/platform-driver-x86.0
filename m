The thing I don't like about my own driver is that, as a WMI device
driver, it can be loaded before the rest of the bus finishes probing.
So user programs that are notified asynchronously that the wmi-mof
driver is loaded and try to use future functionality (ioctl to issue a
MOF-based method call?) might end up doing so before the rest of the
bus is probed.

This could be addressed by always exposing the wmi-mof device last
(sort of -- it can be a module) or perhaps by moving MOF functionality
to the core driver.  Or maybe it's not really a problem.

Also, isn't there a way to ask Microsoft to document this?  Are you
supposed to "ask a question" on this forum, perhaps:

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg134029.aspx

I'm guessing the Samba team knows how to do this, too.
