Can you find out why?  Does the HDA controller have a codec as child
device that doesn't runtime suspend, perhaps because it failed to
initialize correctly?  If a codec device fails to runtime suspend,
the HDA controller (as parent) and by extension the GPU (via the
device link) are also kept runtime active.

Do you see anything in dmesg when the AMD HDA controller probes?
If you look in /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:01:00.1/power/, does the
HDA controller have active kids and what is its usage count?

Could you add this information to the commit message then?

Thanks,
