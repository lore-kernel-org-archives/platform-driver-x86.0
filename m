That's good but odd, good is the patch fixed your issue, odd is the
behavior is not what I want and not match with my TravelMate 8572.

Please then me clear up it. On my TravelMate 8572, the BIOS have 2
different behavior for cold boot (shutdown then press HW power button),
and warm boot (reboot). BIOS is:
	- Cold boot: back to default config is WLAN on, BT off, WWAN on
	- Warm boot: keep the devices state before last time reboot.

So, you can see the above, on my machine when cold boot, the BT state i=
s
off, the rfkill list like following:

linux-7y1r:~ # rfkill list
0: acer-wireless: Wireless LAN
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
1: acer-bluetooth: Bluetooth
        Soft blocked: yes		# BIOS default value is disable when cold bo=
ot
        Hard blocked: no
2: acer-threeg: Wireless WAN
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
3: phy0: Wireless LAN
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no

Then I did rfkill unblock acer-bluetooth (sorry my machine have no BT H=
W key):

linux-7y1r:~ # rfkill unblock 1
linux-7y1r:~ # rfkill list
0: acer-wireless: Wireless LAN
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
1: acer-bluetooth: Bluetooth
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
2: acer-threeg: Wireless WAN
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
3: phy0: Wireless4: hci0: Bluetooth
        Soft blocked: no		#fixed by my patch, hci0's rkfill state defau=
lt is unblock
        Hard blocked: no

I am not sure your TravelMate 5730G's behavior is fully the same with
mine. Could you please find a bit time to look at rfkill state when
system cold boot ?

Of course, please enable rfkill-input and remove any other patch but
only keep my workaround patch:
0001-acer-wmi-remove-rfkill_init_sw_state-to-workaround.patch


Thank's a lot!
