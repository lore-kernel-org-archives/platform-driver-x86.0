Hmm, the 0000 table contains:

         /* Key code is followed by keyboard illumination level */
         { KE_IGNORE, 0xe00c, { KEY_KBDILLUMTOGGLE } },

We could use the same keycode in the 0011 table for kbd brightness events and then do:

	if (event->keycode == KEY_KBDILLUMTOGGLE)
		dell_smbios_kbd_backlight_brightness_changed, NULL);

I will send an updated version using this.

Regards,

Hans
