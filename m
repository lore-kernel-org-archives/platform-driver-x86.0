Henrique, I believe I may have overstepped with thinkpad-acpi and dealt with it
like the other drivers in platform/drivers/x86, when instead I should have been
leaving it to you. My apologies, it was not intentional.

Do you typically send pull-requests for the thinkpad-acpi driver
directly to Linus? Geeze, I see that the tree listed in MAINTAINERS is not even
mine. Ugh, my sincere apologies.

I would be more than happy to basically ignore anything to thinkpad-acpi until
after you have provided a review. I can also roll up pull requests from you if
you prefer to integrate into the platform-drivers-x86 tree as the path to Linus.

How do you want to handle your driver?
