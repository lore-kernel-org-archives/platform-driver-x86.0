This is something we should be able to do with ACPI 5 and SSDTs.

And this too actually. I was thinking along the lines of the tables in
the firmware, but using SSDTs passed in (optionally) at boot, the user
can easily decide not to use the buttons with gpio-keys simply by not
passing in that SSDT. This had been the direction we were going with the
Lures (daughter cards), but we can also apply this to the board itself
as a way to provide a proper example of how to do this.

So the answer seems to be to put any fixed functionality into the board
firmware ACPI tables and leave the optional experimenter config to SSDTs
which the user can choose to use or not.

The rest of what minnowboard.c does (LVDS/GPIO setup) can (and should)
be done in the firmware directly, also eliminating the need for the 3/8
(sch_gpio_resume_set_enable()).
