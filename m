No harm done!  And I did appreciate the extra help :-)

thinkpad-acpi is part of the platform-x86 subsystem, so IMHO it should
continue to be merged through your tree if you are okay with that.

I'd really appreciate if the typical patch approval flux would go
through me first.  However, I certainly don't mind if you merge patches
directly should I be unresponsible for some reason, or when they are
part of the usual tree-wide spot fixes for some pattern/anti-pattern,
etc.

Well, if it is fine with you, I'd suggest we continue with the process
used in this patchset, where I will reply to patches in this ML with a
reviewed-by or acked-by before you merge them.

If you want to change that at some point, just drop me a note and I will
start pushing patches to you either through this ML or through signed
pull requests, whichever you prefer.
