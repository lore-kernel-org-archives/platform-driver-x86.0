I would say both, this matches with the pre-existing
TP_ACPI_HKEY_THNKLGHT_MASK (they have a 1:1 mapping),
keep in mind that there are no thinkpads with both
a thinklight and a backlit keyboard, as those both
serve the same purpose so it looks like the re-used
the scancode.

I've tried this code on both a W541 and a P50 and both
emit TP_ACPI_HOTKEYSCAN_FNPAGEUP for the backlight
keyboard hotkey (fn + space), I'm naming the event for
this TP_HKEY_EV_THINKLIGHT for consistency with the
existing TP_ACPI_HKEY_THNKLGHT_MASK which corresponds
to TP_ACPI_HOTKEYSCAN_FNPAGEUP.

No as said the scancode / event is shared, notice the check for
tp_features.kbdlight, so the notify will only happen on laptops which
actually have a backlit keyboard.
