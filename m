Hi All,

This patch-set is the result of the discussion surrounding the
backlight issues on the Dell Vostro V131. The first 3 patches
cleanup how some platform/x86 drivers detect if acpi-video
is handling brightness key presses and that they should
not report duplicate events. This is a cleanup which I wanted
to do for a while already and the Vostro V131 fix actually
benefits from this.

The last 2 patches together actually fix the issues on the
Vostro V131. Since the 2 platform patches in this set depend
on an acpi patch, I believe that it would be best if this
entire set gets merged via the acpi tree with acks
from the platform driver maintainer.

Regards,

Hans
