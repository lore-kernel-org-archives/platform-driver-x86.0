I admit that my knowledge in this area are limited. I appreciate your
help and straightforward comments.

Perhaps the reason is that not many drivers use eventfd and its way to
arm event thresholds. The userspace passed an eventfd, a file
descriptor, and a threshold value to the RAPL driver. In order to
authenticate the control file descriptor is a valid, I need to check
1. the control file is capable of generating events, e.g. it can be an
energy counter but not a constant power_limit1
2. the control file belongs to the same RAPL domain since the name are
reused in all RAPL domains. e.g. all domains have energy counter and
events are per domain.

I used the sysfs directory check for #2. It is just an extra check. But
I think can drop that check and user pick events based on its name
string. The fact that user writes to the per domain control file
implies the domain specificness of the event.

In similar eventfd usage in cgroup, it has its own fs so i does the
check based on file ops of the control files.

ditto, I will drop that extra check.
