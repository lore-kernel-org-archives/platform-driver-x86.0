It isn't. There are a number of functions that can be triggered using
the Windows key + other buttons on the device, such as:

 ⊞ Win+PrtScr or ⊞ Win+Volume up instantly saves a screenshot to the
"Screenshots" folder in "Pictures" library. All screenshots are saved
as PNG files.

(from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_key#Windows_8)

In Windows, the button behaves the exact same way as the Windows key on
a keyboard would.
