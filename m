It's very nice of Intel to supply source. Also, yikes, they wrote
their ME blob in Java?

How do you generate your root of trust for attestation if you don't
use Intel's service?  If I understand right, Intel's mechanism boils
down to Intel possessing something that is functionally equivalent to
a list of valid provisioning keys associated with genuine Intel chips.
(It could be literal provisioning keys, or keying material from which
the provisioning keys are derived, or even public keys for which the
private parts are derived from the provisioning keys.  But all of this
boils down to the CPU, via some enclaves, proving knowledge of the
provisioning key that is available when MRSIGNER is Intel.

I could imagine replacing this by running Intel's mechanism once to
generate a new root of trust for your own mechanism, or even by buying
a bunch of CPUs, determining their provisioning keys with MRSIGNER=Dr.
Greg, and enrolling those.  But I don't see any way to bootstrap an
attestation service on a CPU you've never physically possessed without
running *something* with MRSIGNER=Intel.

I'm a little bit puzzled by your privacy claims.  If an attacker
controls the kernel, then the secrets in your enclave may still be
secure, but you have very little privacy in terms of trying to prevent
the attacker from tying your communication to your physical machine.

I agree, hence my email :)

Can you explain your use case for a launch enclave?  The current
driver won't allow you to supply an EINITTOKEN, so I'm not immediately
seeing what you would do with a launch token.  If you really do need
it, I suppose we could have 'unprivileged', 'provisioning', and
'launch' nodes, and maybe even 'launch_and_provision', but that's
starting to have some combinatorial issues.
