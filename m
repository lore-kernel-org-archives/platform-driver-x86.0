One doubt: say we have hdd activity LED on the "main box" - it
would be named "platform::disk".

Now, we add external USB disk. Previously we were considering
the naming for disk LEDs in the form e.g. "sdb::disk".

If so, there would be discrepancy between internal and external disk
LED names. Similarly in case of eth/adsl/wlan/camera LEDs.

Regarding sound devices - how would we name micmute LED for USB
microphone? I suppose that it is possible to discover some unique
identifier in runtime - this is a question to ALSA people.
