Currently i2c-multi-instantiate driver does not support the case
of INT3515 USB PD device, where:

- Interrupt() is used instead of GpioInt()
- All slaves may be the same from IP point of view
- There can be variadic amount of slaves

This series is addressing all above.

Notes:
- series has been smoke tested (Heikki would do BAT or more) on Coffee Lake system
- patch for BOSC0200 might be considered as RFC since the modalias potential issue

The idea is to push this either through PDx86 tree (needs Rafael's ACKs) or ACPI.
In any case it needs tags from Heikki, Hans, Mika, Wolfram and Jonathan.

Testing and comments are warmly welcome.
