Well FWIW I did a quick PoC check with the binary that I got out of it to m=
ake=20
sure it matched what was supposed to be.  I brought it over to a Win10 box =
and=20
decompiled using the mofcmp tool and those crazy arguments I mentioned and=
=20
it was correct.

I'd argue that even if there is no open source tools available today, not m=
aking=20
the data available to userspace makes it difficult to even attempt to start=
=20
to reverse engineer.

Kernel config with default of "N" perhaps for wmi-mof?

Microsoft treats this as an "intermediary" format.  I'm not convinced
that anyone other than MS knows anything about it today.

I agree asking them to document it is probably the right way to go.
