What's this?  We already have KEY_MICMUTE.  Is this different?  If so, 
can you improve the comment a bit?

The answer may be obvious to anyone who has an awful X1 carbon gen 2 
keyboard, but these KEY_XYZ defines should IMO be clear enough that even 
people without the hardware can figure out what's going on.
