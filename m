So are you suggesting we simply go over all /sys/devices/pnp0/00:xx devices looking
for a pnp-id we're interested  in ?  I'm sorry but that is just a non-sense solution,
which reminds me of the good old days of random poking io-ports to probe stuff.

We're not blindly going to read every /sys/devices/pnp0/00:xx/id attribute on a
system, assuming that if it contains a pnp-id we're interested in it happens to
belong to the input device we're enumerating at that time.

Regards,

Hans
