If I'm parsing this correctly, previously a time==0 was valid, and now it will
return -EINVAL. Is that intentional?

So the time range change appears intentional. Why is that?

opposite

Is it "opposite" or "current"?

actual... as in the mode you are changing to or the mode you are changing from?

From the previous keyboard backlight type patch:

toshiba_acpi: Support new keyboard backlight type

There are several keyboard modes, why do we have only 2 of them here? Is it
because by setting the timeout we are always changing to _AUTO? Even if that's
the case, shouldn't one of these be OR'ing in the current mode - whatever it is,
instead of a fixed one?

So here you are changing the sysfs API as you can now return -ENODEV in addition
to -EIO. We *can* do this, but it is a risk, and if a regression is reported, I
will be forced to revert this patch.
