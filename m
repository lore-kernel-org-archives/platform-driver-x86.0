basically the driver receives in IRQ, reads from the IO port a value
that turns out to be a generic value that means "got a hotkey" and needs
to write one more command to the IO port and wait for another IRQ that
potentially has the information about what hotkey was pressed.

The part we're currently missing is what to write to the IO port for
some models.

See type3_handle_irq in the source and type3_events: most of those with
data=0x05 require extra handling that we are not doing. 
On the second IRQ you get some data=0x31 and the actual event.

Hope it's clearer.
