What I've discussed with the various driver maintainers is they should reply
within a week, and after that, I (now Andy and/or I) will make the decision.

I try to stick to this especially for functional changes. For DMI matches and
new HIDs and other trivial things, I usually just queue to testing and ask the
maintainer if they have any objections, and take silence for accent :)

I do think there is value in getting the patch into testing as soon as possible,
even while waiting for the driver maintainer to get to it. The risk would be
accidentally committing a patch a maintainer objects to. I don't think this has
happened yet as an email from the maintainer can trigger dropping the patch. We
can discuss how to manage the corner cases offline.
