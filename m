Hello,

pressing some keys on laptops could cause some side effects.

Example scenario 1:

Laptop has Fn key for enabling/disabling WIFI and when that key=20
is pressed BIOS is doing two things:

1) Switch hard rfkill state of WIFI
2) Report that Fn key was pressed to kernel
   (either via i8042 bus or via ACPI/WMI)

Example scenario 2:

Another laptop has Fn key too, but BIOS does not change state of=20
hard rfkill. So system (kernel or userspace) is responsible for=20
interpreting what that Fn key means and call correct action (find=20
rfkill device for WIFI and soft block it).

And my questions are:

1) What should userspace do if some input device report that=20
KEY_WLAN or KEY_RFKILL was pressed?

2) Should kernel report to userspace that (on specific laptop)=20
has pressed key some side effect?

3) How to deal with existing userspace application which=20
interpret all pressed keys as described in example scenario 2=20
also on laptops from scenario 1? KDE4, NetworkManager, ... are=20
know to do that!

Note that this problem is not only about rfkill/wifi keys. Same=20
apply for keyboard brightness Fn keys and also for key=20
KEY_KBDILLUMTOGGLE (which toggle keyboard illumination level).
