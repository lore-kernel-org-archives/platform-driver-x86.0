Perhaps I'm not clear, I didn't mean non-Windows 8 systems will all favor
GPU's interface, I just meant for one specific win7 laptop I could re-use
the existing code to make the GPU's interface as the only one left. And to
achieve this, the Win8 OSI check in acpi_video_verify_backlight_support
has to be gone.

BTW, I actually think use_native_backlight param should mean "the native
backlight control interface will be the only one available on the system",
it doesn't need to go side by side with Win8 OSI check.

Good to know this, thanks.

OK, but I honestly don't have any idea how to proceed, in case you have
some time, the bug is:
