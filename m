No evaluation of AML methods from user space, please.

This is plain dangerous, because you never know what those things do and doing
that on production systems is just a plain "no".

You can, however, expose the output of AML methods this way or another,
for example if they are expected to generate packages of data or similar.

The interface for that cannot be "evaluate this random method right now and
give me the result", though.

Right.
