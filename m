Just expose these devices in the device-tree. You shouldn't *need* a new
MTD device driver; physmap_of should be just fine.

If your bootloader doesn't pass one, your platform-specific code should
just register its own device-tree blob during early boot. And your
device drivers should just match against the devices therein.
