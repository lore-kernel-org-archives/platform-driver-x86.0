What do we gain by a single buffer vs. separate buffers?  The ioctl()
would be slightly smaller but it seems like the actual code would be
more complex.

The enclave build process also utilizes the backing as temp storage
to avoid having to alloc kernel memory when queueing pages to be added
by the worker thread (which reminds me that I wanted to document why a
worker thread is used).  Keeping this behavior would effectively make
providing backing mandatory.

Are there any potential complications with ENCLS consuming userspace
pointers?  We'd have to wrap them with user_access_{begin,end}() and
probably tweak the fixup, but I assume having the fixup handler means
we're generally ok?
