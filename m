No, with the patch, it worked out-of-the-box.

I can even control the brightness in
`/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness' (it affects both
displays at the same time though). But even at 0, it's still perfectly
readable.

Maybe this a bug that got fixed recently? I've actually tried the 3.1
kernel (and then the 3.2-rc4) because I noticed a lot of commits and
improvements in the i915 driver recently.
