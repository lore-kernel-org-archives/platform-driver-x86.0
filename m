I will review the above. However, a new API can be treated as separate =
from
the refactoring which is all this series really does. It doesn't do any=
thing
that I saw beyond moving existing code into a separate module and wrapp=
ing the
use of the buffer and tokens. In that sense, it seems to me that this c=
an be
considered a first step toward a redesigned API by first removing dupli=
cate code
and reusing some of the existing code.
