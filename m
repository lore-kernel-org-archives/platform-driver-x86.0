It is mandatory to secure a reliable readout of the brightness value
set by the hardware. Without it, we could end up reading brightness
set in the meantime either by trigger or by userspace. Knowing that
value can be useful in case hardware tries to lower the brightness
level set by the user for some reason (e.g. low battery voltage).

However, I'd tweak the file name a bit, to make it clear
what property the file represents - the brightness changed
by the hardware, effectively I'm proposing the property:

brightness_hw_changed
