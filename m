Hi,

The samsung-laptop.c driver got merged into drivers/platform/x86/, but a
copy also stayed in drivers/staging and further fixes got applied there.
A parallel build decides randomly which version to link into
samsung-laptop.ko, so this cannot work even if it was intentional. This
series applies the missing patches to drivers/platform/x86/ and deletes
the old version.
