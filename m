But which DO exist.  Let's not go there.

Why state incorrect information?  No kernel driver needs this new Kconfig
option to work, it is required only for *userspace* access to the EC
register space.  IMHO, it would better to say this:

"This option allows userspace direct access to the EC registers, for
debugging and kernel driver development purposes".

Which is entirely correct and gets the proper idea of its intended usage
across (it is not intended to be used for userspace drivers, AFAIK).
