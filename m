And let me guess - two phase hotkey decoding is sufficiently weird that
nobody wants to actually fix *that* code, right? (Rhetorical question, I
already know the answer to that one).

If that's not an option, perhaps we need a per-model quirk that patches up the
tables at boot time?  If we do that, we may want to re-arrange the table so the
affected entries are at the front or something to help insure we don't patch
the wrong entries if somebody else inserts new lines.
