I think we agree this would be an ideal approach.

As we look into this more, it is becoming clear that the necessary functionality
is not nicely divided into GUIDs for what is necessary in userspace and what is
handled in the kernel. A single WMI METHOD GUID may be needed by userspace for
certain functionality, while the kernel drivers may use it for something else.

:-(

The input to a WMI method is just a buffer, so it is very free form. One
approach Mario has mentioned was to audit the user space WMI METHOD calls in the
kernel platform drivers and reject those calls with arguments matching those
issued by the kernel driver. This is likely to be complex and error prone in my
opinion. However, I have not yet thought of another means to meet the
requirement of having disjoint feature sets for userspace and kernel space via a
mechanism that was effectively designed to be used solely from user space with
vendor defined method signatures.

Next step is to look at just how complex it would be to audit the method calls
the kernel currently uses.
