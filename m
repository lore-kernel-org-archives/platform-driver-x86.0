Sorry, I don't quite understand:  The AMD variant *also* has an audio
controller, so what's the difference?  Or did you mean the Nvidia
variant *doesn't* have an audio controller?

Pretty much all modern Nvidia GPUs do have an integrated HDA
controller, however it's possible to hide it by clearing a bit
at offset 0x488 in the GPU's config space.  Some BIOSes hide
the HDA if no external display is attached.

I could imagine that the BIOS of the Dell machines in question
hides the HDA if Switchable Graphics is enabled.  If that is the
case, be aware that there's an ongoing discussion to always expose
the HDA controller because the behavior of some BIOSes to only
expose the HDA when a display is attached causes massive problems
with Linux' HDA driver:
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75985

If we decide to always expose the HDA controller on Nvidia cards,
you may need to also match for the Nvidia vendor ID here.

Thanks,

Lukas
