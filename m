I also agree push the wifi key logic to userland application has more
flexibility.

Highly suggest you can use urfkill daemon:
http://www.google.com.tw/search?sourceid=3Dchrome&ie=3DUTF-8&q=3Durfkil=
l

It support KEY_WIRELESS, KEY_BLUETOOTH and KEY_RFKILL, and you can setu=
p
the wifi key rule on urfkill daemon.=20
Please feel free send patch to Gary Lin <GLin@novell.com>, he can merge
your key rule for ideapad.


Thank's
Joey Lee
