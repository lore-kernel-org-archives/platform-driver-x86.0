See Documentation/process/license-rules.rst. Headers should go with
C-style comments:

   The SPDX license identifier is added in form of a comment.  The comment
   style depends on the file type::

      C source: // SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX License Expression>
      C header: /* SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX License Expression> */

And:

   If a specific tool cannot handle the standard comment style, then the
   appropriate comment mechanism which the tool accepts shall be used. This
   is the reason for having the "/\* \*/" style comment in C header
   files. There was build breakage observed with generated .lds files where
   'ld' failed to parse the C++ comment. This has been fixed by now, but
   there are still older assembler tools which cannot handle C++ style
   comments.

The ones that got in are probably either old or they slipped through
(and they do not break the build).

Cheers,
Miguel
