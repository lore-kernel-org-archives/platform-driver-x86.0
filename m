In this case the notification is purely at the ALSA level, so there's no 
harm caused by duplicate notifications.

Passing the parameter is... difficult. That would involve rather more 
surgery to the ACPI core, since the parameters are core-internal objects 
at this point. It's an obvious feature though, so I'll look into it some 
more.

The call is made after executing the original method, yes.
