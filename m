Not really :(
I would have expected to see something like that:
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX S Co:1:XXX:0 s 21 09 0202 0002 0004 4 = XXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX C Co:1:XXX:0 0 4 >

(SET_REPORT on the report ID 02 with a data length of 4)

The capture seems to confuse the windows driver and it is not
initialized correctly.

Long shot: maybe if you start the capture before attaching the device
to the Windows VM (or launching it) it will be in a better shape.

I would say that as long as the device do not work under the VM with
the capture, we are really screwed.

Cheers,
Benjamin
