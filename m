Why everybody must be forced to poll() on brightness file?

For other cases, you need to communicate with the desktop.

Your proposal does not help you with your problem, unless you get
desktop people to poll() on the brightness files, and do something
inteligent with the results.

Hmm. And doing something inteligent will be quite hard given that we
have 6 of those files on N900.

So, if you seriously want to do this, can you

1) write specification explaining how desktops should poll() the
brightness files

2) get someone to volunteer to implement that specification for at
least GNOME and KDE?
