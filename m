Thank you for reporting this Michael,

That is tough as nouveau doesn't have an explicit dependency on gmux, so we
could do something like a passive request_module(), but if it isn't in the
initrd image, it would still fail as you describe.

It should print an error if the probe fails due to the IO already being in use
or if it can't be allocated. The disabled IO case is only info level though,
perhaps that should be higher priority. Printing something when failing to probe
seems like a reasonable thing to do.

Michael, which message do you get if you boot with "debug" or "loglevel=6" when
apple-gmux is not built-in?
