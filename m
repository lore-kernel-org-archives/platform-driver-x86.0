Blarg, this also violates the kconfig-language guidance for using select
only for non-visible symbols with no dependencies.

I have a patch that works, but I don't love it. We can remove the prompt
from DELL_SMBIOS, and make DELL_SMBIOS_WMI|SMM "depend on" DELL_SMBIOS.
The options just appear sort of randomly when either DELL_LAPTOP or
DELL_WMI are selected - but they can default to y, which is nice.

I have a subsequent patch which makes DELL_SMBIOS_WMI|SMM "depend on"
DELL_LAPTOP, which makes this look a lot nicer. These just appear under
DELL_LAPTOP as bool options. The problem with this approach is DELL_WMI
also requires DELL_SMBIOS and DELL_WMI doesn't currently depend on
DELL_LAPTOP. One option is to make it depend on DELL_LAPTOP as it seems
unlikely for them to ever be used separately.  I don't love this either.
Thoughts?

Perhaps the compromise is leave the DELL_SMBIOS prompt. This doesn't
have the negative consequences the kconfig-languages is trying to guard
against, and it makes it obvious what the DELL_SMBIOS_* options are -
and we can still default them to y. See below.

This seems like it might be the least bad option at the moment. I'll
keep thinking on it a bit...

Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86: Allow for SMBIOS backend defaults

Avoid accidental configurations by setting default y for DELL_SMBIOS
backends. Avoid this impacting the default build size, by making them
dependent on DELL_SMBIOS, so they only appear when DELL_SMBIOS is
manually selected, or by DELL_LAPTOP or DELL_WMI.
