I'm guessing the cost is negligible, given that SMBIOS calls are not
present in any hot path.  Writing these functions is also pretty
straightforward, but the inconvenience of this approach is that it
forces the callers to do the error-checking for each buf_alloc() call.
It also seems pretty inefficient - notice we only need 36 bytes for the
calling interface buffer, yet we would be allocating a whole page in
each buf_alloc() call.

On the other hand, I believe returning a separate buffer for each
buf_alloc() caller makes it possible to drop buffer_mutex altogether.
Yet, the approach I suggested is more similar to what the Dell-supplied
dcdbas driver does internally (it manages a single, resizable buffer,
which is protected by a mutex and controllable from userspace through
sysfs), which is why I think it's a good idea to stick to that concept
for consistency.

As this patch series already touches a lot of code, I would like to
avoid changing the underlying concepts as much as possible.  If that's
okay with you, I'll post a v2 which includes your suggestion to make th=
e
buffer pointer static while keeping the interface similar to the
original one.  If you would really like me to take a different path,
please let me know and I'll comply.
