Hi Guenter,

I've took a closer look to the manual and that's right, in fact the
driver doesn't talk to the MAX197 directly. The board uses a CPLD to
abstract the interface to the MAX197. So all the MAX197 logic is hidden
by the CPLD.  Therefore, the driver files should probably not have
function and structure names with a "max197_" prefix. I'll make the code
a bit clearer. What do you think?

Ok for iio subsystem, several ADC drivers are in drivers/hwmon/ but
drivers/staging/iio/adc seems to be the good place now.

Regards,
Vivien.
