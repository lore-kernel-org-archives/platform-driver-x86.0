I am not fully understanding how the bios query ID gets translated into 
the method. As far as I can tell this happens under HWMC. But, if I 
trace through that, 0x8(write) and 0x9(read) do not exist. However, 
0x9(read) does have a method that works when I query it, GHKS. I do not 
find the method for 0x8(write).

0x9(write), or SHKS, is essentially ec_write(SFHK,Arg0). Arg0 turns out 
to be whatever data is sent in the 0x9 buffer.
                                 ...
                                 CreateDWordField (Arg1, 0x10, DDWD)

                                 If (LEqual (CMDT, 0x09))
                                 {
                                     Store (SHKS (DDWD), Local2)
                                 ...

I tried writing 0x60, and I tried writing 0x0e just to see if it if a 
subset of that register is needed to enable the keys and it seems I need 
the full 0x6e. I only find two places in the DSDT with that value, both 
in the WQAE buffer and I can't see how that is used.
