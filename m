the acpi_video0 on my machine does nothing. The intel_backlight has
the described bug and the samsung SABI backlight needs the fix that
setting the backlight only works from/to 0 and 7 (this fix is already
upstream).

The SABI thing is working for me so I'd prefer it. I have a N210P
which is detected as: N150P/N210P/N220P

I hope that helps
