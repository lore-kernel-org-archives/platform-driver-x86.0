Running with it right now. Unless I missed one, the messages do happen 
exactly every five seconds. Here are the first few lines of the dmesg 
(grepping for 'intel ips'), and it does seem a bit strange:

I think you put the parameters in the wrong order on the dev_info() call 
for the CPU power limit; it is the limit that is 0.

Two bogus things I can see:

- The first "MCP power limit exceeded" seems very bogus.
- What do you mean, core_power_limit is zero?

I will go back to 2.6.35; not feeling like debugging my (unrelated) 
suspend/resume problem right now. If you have another debugging patch, I 
will probably test it only tomorrow night.
