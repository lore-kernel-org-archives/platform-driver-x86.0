Well, my point was that the compromised userspace could still record
from other possibly connected microphones (such as USB or bluetooth
headsets).

But I guess one compromise could be to refuse userspace turn the mic
mute LED on, if the internal mic is unmuted.
Userspace would still be able to turn the mic mute LED off, to indicate
that recording can happen from other sources. It will be slightly more
complex for userspace though.
