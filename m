Matthew: Are you okay with this, or is there some better way to do it?

I'm looking at Andreas's code for switcharoo support, and something I
want to do along with it is make apple-gmux not dependent on backlight
support (i.e. you can still build switcharoo support if
BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE is disabled). I'm assuming this patch as a
prerequisite. But things do get really monstrously ugly, so if there's a
cleaner way to enforce this that I haven't found I'd love to hear about
it.

Thanks,
Seth
