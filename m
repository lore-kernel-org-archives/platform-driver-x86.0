What I'm thinking is an explicit list of GUIDs within the drivers which are to
be exposed to user space. The rationale being:

* GUIDs which are managed by kernel drivers (LEDs, hotkeys, etc.) should not be
  exposed to userspace.

* Management GUIDs should not change frequently

* Management GUIDs are a trivial add, equivalent to adding a DEVICE ID to an
  existing driver. This means minimal review time to get upstream, and the
  ability to include in stable backports as needed. I haven't confirmed
  this with Greg KH, but I think I can make the case, especially after
  Andy L's WMI-as-a-bus patches.

That would be consistent with the above in my opinion.
