Hi Mario,

Could you attach or upload the DSDT of S12 somewhere I can reach?
I check DSDT for S10-3 and B550, return value of _CFG is fixed.

[Ref: http://people.ubuntu.com/~ikepanhc/DSDTs]

you may use "sudo cp /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/DSDT ." and
"sudo iasl -d /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/DSDT" to decode it.

sounds like we need an exception handle for detecting camera

As I know the cfgbit for lower 16bit shall not be all zero.

bluetooth device shall disappear after disable from EC. But if can not be enabled

This looks like the device is power up, but usb host unable to recognize..

did you see any kernel message said timeout when it does not come back at all?

I guess so. so I need DSDT for digging more.

when you use rfkill of hci0, it only disable PHY. The driver and MAC is still
there. The rfkill of ideapad-laptop will power down all the module. I believe
its normal.

I think it shall be correct.

If the rfkill for the whole bluetooth module makes trouble, I prefer not to
do it. User will feel confused if the device does not come back and the
rfkill of hci0 offers the function user need.
