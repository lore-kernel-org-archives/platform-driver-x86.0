The firmware interface pre-dates ACPI.  Samsung seems to have only
started using ACPI for their newest models, as it's a requirement for
Win7 certification.  But even there, they still rely on their SABI
interface for the majority of the "odd" hardware control knobs,
including the backlight control, which baffles me even to this day.
