Hi Dmitry,

Sorry for the late reply.

I'll resend the patch with the changes you suggested, however,
I'll change the description since this patch does not add _FULL_
support to TOS1900 devices.

I recently got a new laptop (Qosmio X505-Q898), which turns out
it had a TOS1900 device as well, however, none of the known
methods activate hotkeys on this model.

Searching in the DSDT, I found a WMI interface, so if someone
is interested in having a look on the DSDT let me know so I
can attach the file.


Saludos
Azael
