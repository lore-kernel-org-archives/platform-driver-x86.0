What would prevent you to take PCI device marked with Dell ID and put it
into non-Dell computer? I do not believe that Dell PCI devices are
configured to work only in Dell branded devices and refuse to power up
in others.

If there is Dell ID then it just means that PCI device itself is Dell's.
And not that machine in which that device is plugged is also Dell.

Yes, extending commit message is a good idea.

But here I'm talking about future, NVIDIA cards could be in future.

I still think that whitelisting devices based on vendor ID by some
measurements at one time is a bad idea. It is fragile which can stop
working in the future.
