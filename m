I thought we agreed that this was not an MFD driver?

If it doesn't use the MFD framework, it's not an MFD driver.

Looking at it very briefly, it appears at though it should actually be
split up.  In your commit message you say that this is a platform
driver that does LED handling and deals with the regmap and HWMON
subsystem.

I suggest moving the core code into /drivers/platform/* and split the
other sections into their own drivers within their own subsystems.
