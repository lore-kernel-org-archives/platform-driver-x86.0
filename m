Hi Alen,

  Thank you for your comment.

  I was devided between drivers/net and platform-x86...

    I know. Unfortunately currently there's no good HP to illustrate 
    Extended Socket.

   This interface is used to interconnect multiple instances of Linux 
   (currently only Linux) LOGICALLY (called Extended Partiton) partitioned
   running PRIMEQUEST.

   That document is for PRIMEQUEST 400/500 series, so it's a bit old though basic conception is not so far.

   The following manual is useful to understand Extend Partiton and
   Extended Socket.
