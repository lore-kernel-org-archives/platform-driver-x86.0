So far I know this event (coming with vpc_bit=1) is for Lenovo PM utility
on Windows. For most of the machine this event is not implemented in BIOS.

Its ok that we just ignore the event.

I think it will be better if we can let sparse-keymap or any upper level
application to ignore all unknown scancode or KEY_UNKNOWN but so far I do
not know a better way then this patch.
