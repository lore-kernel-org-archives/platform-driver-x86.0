Cool, I take it that you started working on that ;-)

Actually no, we don't support all _DEP in Linux yet. But that's not the
problem though. See below.

That is using GPIO pins of the PMI2 device - the PMIC GPIO driver, I
suppose.

So in addition to the PMIC MFD driver, you need to have a GPIO driver
for Dollar Cove (I guess the quilt patch series included that as well?).

If you look under the /sys/bus/acpi/devices/DEVICE, it should include
bunch of physical_nodeX links. Those are the subdevices of the MFD so
when the GPIO driver registers the GPIO core then automatically installs
GPIO OpRegion handler.

Probably because the PMIC does not have anything to report yet. When you
add the DCOVE GPIO driver, and start receiving input events from the
button array, then you should see that interrupt count increasing. If
everything works correctly.
