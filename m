Hello, same problem happen again on my notebook. Problematic=20
commit is now: b253c9d1d858a3f115f791ee4fe2b9399ae7dbbd
hp-wmi: Enable hotkeys on some systems

When I disabled calling function hp_wmi_enable_hotkeys() from=20
hp_wmi_init() keys started working again after reboot.

This problem is present in 3.11 rc5. Please can you do something=20
so keys on my notebook will work again and it will not be broken=20
again in next kernel release? If you need some debug data or=20
something else, I can help.

In mail from 16.04.2013 you provided similar patch but with
#define HPWMI_BIOS_QUERY 0x8
I tested that patch and that does not broke keys.

But commit b253c9d1d858a3f115f791ee4fe2b9399ae7dbbd have
#define HPWMI_BIOS_QUERY 0x9
which broke keys again...
