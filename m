Yes I've read the commit message...

Since I don't have access to the acpidump of this system, my only
question is, does the firmware has a _OSI("Windows 2012") query in DSDT
table?

I think they are related...
If the firmware is compatible to Windows 8, then my patch will disable
ACPI video backlight interface to prefer GPU's interface.

Yes, the Windows 2012 setting is irrelevant to ACPI's interface(with or
without it, it doesn't work), but it's relevant to my patch as that is
the condition we are using to decide if we should skip registering ACPI
video's backlight interface.

Right, that is needed. And if going with my patch, the ideapad driver
will need to be patched similarly like thinkpad_acpi to add a check of
acpi_video_backlight_support before it decides to register its own
backlight interface.
