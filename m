That requires adding error checking to all callers, since this
error will only happen if there is a bug in the kernel / driver
code I've instead done this:

void led_classdev_notify_brightness_hw_changed(struct led_classdev *led_cdev,
                                                enum led_brightness brightness)
{
         if (WARN_ON(!led_cdev->brightness_hw_changed_kn))
                 return;

         led_cdev->brightness_hw_changed = brightness;
         sysfs_notify_dirent(led_cdev->brightness_hw_changed_kn);
}

With avoids the need for error checks in all callers, while still catching
the error.

Ok, I will update Documentation/leds/leds-class.txt for v8.
