I want to remove the above API this cycle, and just a few patches have
not made it into 5.8-rc1. They have been reviewed and most had been
promised to get into linux-next, but well, things happen. So, I hope it
is okay for everyone to collect them like this and push them via I2C for
5.8-rc2.

One minor exception is the media documentation patch which I simply have
missed so far, but it is trivial.

And then, finally, there is the removal of the old API as the final
patch. Phew, that's been a long ride.

I am open for comments, of course.

Happy hacking,

   Wolfram
