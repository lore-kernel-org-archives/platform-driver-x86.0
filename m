If other maintainers are OK with it, yes, I think that would be the
easiest way. Thanks for proposing. All these patches depend on each
other and must be applied in the right order, so pushing them through
different trees would be slow at best, and risky.

Also, thinking about it, I wonder if the first 3 patches of the series
could go to longterm kernel series? While they do not fix any build
breakage nor run-time bug, without them everyone (on x86 at least) is
forced to build dead code. This is kind of frustrating. They are simple
and obvious enough that hopefully there won't be any objection.

Thanks,
