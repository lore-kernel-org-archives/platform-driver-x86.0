The determination for what gets sent to Linus at what point in the rc cycle is
*really* subjective and involves a number of human factors. e.g. If it would
have been OK for RC2, but the maintainer was sick that week and Linus was
trigger happy, then by RC4 it might no longer be deemed acceptable change. It
just isn't as black and white as we'd sometimes like processes to be. Things
like this are also prioritized relative the other patches and fixes in the queue
at the time, which affects where available time can be spent.

Perhaps we made the wrong call here, that's entirely possible, and I'm perfectly
up to accepting that. It's also possible if you had all the context from that
time (which cannot be embodied entirely in the email thread) you would have made
the same call. So, points well taken, and I will certainly be more aware of
these sorts of issues going forward.
