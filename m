Yes. But that's not because of the WMI interface. They both just belong
to the same BIOS implementation. There's no reason why a future machine
couldn't have this WMI interface along with a working INFO
implementation.

For now that's theoretical though, so I'll change it to use the guid
instead of the blacklist. If such a machine appears in the future we can
deal with it then.
