Linux makes extensive use of custom ELF header sections,
documentation for these are well scattered. Unify this
documentation in a central place and provide helpers to
build custom Linux sections.

This also generalizes sections code to enable avoiding
modifying the linker scripts when we want to add new
custom Linux sections. In order to make this generally
useful we need to ensure all architectures can make use of
core section helpers but that they can also override should
this be needed. Instead of relying on section.h this adds
a sections-core.h since this will be targeted to be safe
to be used on asm code, linker scripts and C code.

v7: ran ispell to fix spelling as requested by Boris

v5:

o Huge documentation revamp based on a careful review of the ELF
  specifications. Includes documentation now also about usage of
  two dots (..) when prefixing ELF program specific sections.

o Replace macros for sections names in favor of just using
  the section names explicitly in the linker script. This is
  perhaps more work to grep but this is what folks seem to
  currently prefer.

o Fix .text and .rodata documentation to explain memory protection
  strategies which architectures can embrace upon initialization
  (documents CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA and mark_rodata_ro())

o Skip the 'Linux section ordering' documentation section, we'll instead
  add this on subsequent patch which will expand on it considerably

o Dropped tree on MAINTAINERS -- as per discussions with Arnd, hpa and
  Josh, its easier to just let changes for sections go in through the
  respective tree that needs the changes.

o Fix typos on documentation

o Dropped SECTION_ALL(), __SECTION_CORE(), SECTION_CORE_ALL() macros
  since we are favoring using explicit section names. These are
  useless if we are being explicit.

o Drop LINUX_SECTION_SIZE(), LINUX_SECTION_EMPTY() in favor of having
  section ranges and linker tables define their own, to avoid confusion
  and make code more readable.

o Add __define_initcall() documentation and a small section describing
  our current initcall levels. This should help also clarify what was
  meant about keeping backward compatibility.

v4:

o Port to shiny new sphinx documentation format

o fix a unicore32 build, turns out this actually fixes unicore32
  defconfig builds which were failing for a long while. unicore32
  does not seem to grok well the type passed on a section declaration,
  this ignores it.

o Use VMLINUX_SYMBOL() in more user symbols (extern C code), not doing
  this was causing final linker issues with blackfin -- this is
  a CONFIG_HAVE_UNDERSCORE_SYMBOL_PREFIX=y architecture. The other one
  being metatag. metatag is not supported on 0-day so I cannot confirm
  compilation there.

o Added SECTION_CORE() for C code, used later by __LINUX_RANGE()

o Since SECTION_CORE() is defined for linker script and C code, share
  the same helper and just use a __stringify() for the C code as is done
  for the other C helpers.

o move generic sections to asm-generic/section-core.h instead.
  PowerPC compilation blows up if asm/jump_labels.h gets
  section.h included, fixing this is not in any way easy.
  The list of issues are endless. Moving new data to a new
  simple file resolves this.

o since things are now in asm-generic/section-core.h the
  guard changes on asm-generic/sections.h and each architecture
  sections.h are no longer needed

o Give generic sections some maintainer love, that change is
  Acked-by Arnd Bergmann, Josh and hpa.

o A few checkpatch.pl style fixes

o As suggested by James Hogan use generic-y to copy generic
  header files on architectures that do not have a sections.h
  instead of writing a simple file only to include the generic one.

v3:

o add missing sections.h for architectures that did not
  have it

o move generic sections to asm-generic/sections.h

o add generic asm helpers section_type(), section_type_asmtype(),
  push_section_type() -- these helpers enable easy use for
  for later declaring and using of custom Linux sections using
  more standard APIs in both C code, asm code (C asm calls, or
  asm files), enabling future standardized section types to
  be more immediately accessible to asm code, not just C code.
  Note for ASM_CMD_SEP we use by default "\n", architectures needed
  to override can do so on their own sections.h prior to inclusion
  of asm-generic/sections.h

+======================
+ELF section background
+======================
+
+About
+=====
+
+The purpose of this chapter is to help those not familiar with ELF to brush up
+the latest ELF specifications in order to help understand how Linux uses and
+defines its own ELF sections.
+
+Standardized ELF
+================
+
+The first publication documenting ELF was UNIX System Laboratories' (USL)
+*System V Release 4 Application Binary Interface* (`SRV4 ABI`_) specification.
+Originally ELF was only a small part of the SRV4 ABI, with time however new
+specifications only put focus on ELF, such was the case of the *TIS Portable
+Formats Specification version 1.2* (`TIS 1.2`_). As of TIS 1.2, ELF was
+supplemented with processor specific ELF addendums, available on the *Linux
+Foundation referenced specification page* (`LF ref page`_). The latest ELF
+specification is the *System V Application Binary Interface - DRAFT - 24 April
+2001* (`gabi4`_).
+
+.. _SRV4 ABI: http://www.sco.com/developers/devspecs/gabi41.pdf
+.. _TIS 1.2: https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/elf.pdf
+.. _LF ref page: https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/
+.. _gabi4: https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/gabi4+/contents.html
+
+ELF views on Linux
+==================
+
+There are two views which can be used for inspecting data in an ELF file, a
+Linking view, and an Execution view. A Section Header Table enables one to
+describe an object using the Linking view while a Program Header Table enables
+one to describe an object using the Execution view. The views are not mutually
+exclusive. For instance, vmlinux can be viewed under both views, ``readelf -S
+vmlinux`` for the Linking view, and ``readelf -l vmlinux`` for the Execution
+view.  In Linux only the vmlinux file will have an Execution view, even modules
+lack an Execution view given that vmlinux is the only file that describes how
+the the kernel runs from the start.  All other Linux kernel object files have
+an available Linking view.
+
+Under the Linking view, the Section Header Table describes all available
+sections. The Section Header Table is an array of ELF section header data
+structures. If on a 32-bit system this is ``struct elf32_shd``, if on a 64-bit
+this is ``struct elf64_shdr``. Sections are only visible on object files that
+have a Linking view, since all Linux kernel files have Linking view, all kernel
+objects have ELF sections.
+
+Limitations on ELF sections
+===========================
+
+We provide a summary on the limitations of ELF sections. Refer to the public
+ELF specifications for details. Note that 64-bit limitations may depend
+on processor specific section attributes to be used, refer to your processor
+specification if unsure.
+
+Its worth elaborating on the limitations on the name of an ELF section:
+ELF section names are stored as strings as per the ELF specification, and
+as can be expected, these don't have explicit limitations. The implicit
+limitation then depends on the size of an ELF object file and ELF section.
+
+If using really large kernels or objects with large amounts of sections one
+would still need to be sure that ELF loader in charge of loading the Linux
+kernel is properly updated to handle coping with the latest ELF extensions.
+
+   .. flat-table:: Limitations on ELF Sections
+
+      * - Section attribute
+        - 32-bit
+        - 64-bit
+
+      * - ELF section name
+        - Size of an ELF section
+        - Size of an ELF section
+
+      * - Size of an ELF section
+        - 4 GiB
+        - 16 EiB
+
+      * - Max number of sections in an object file
+        - 4 GiEntries (4294967296)
+        - 16 EiEntries (18446744073709551616)
+
+Program specific ELF sections
+=============================
+
+The ELF specification allows for a section type to be specified as
+*Program specific section*, defined as ``SHT_PROGBITS``. This sections type
+enables programs to customize sections for their own use. In assembly this
+specified ``@progbits`` on most architectures, on ARM this is ``%progbits``.
+
+``SHT_PROGBITS`` is used by Linux for defining and using Linux ELF sections.
+
+Special ELF Sections
+====================
+
+The ELF specification defines *Special ELF Sections* on chapter 4 (`gabi4
+ch4`_). These are defined as sections which hold program and control
+information. Of these sections, a few have the section type as
+``SHT_PROGBITS``. This enables Linux to *further customize* use of the section
+beyond what the ELF specification suggests.

+=========================
+Linux Kernel ELF sections
+=========================
+
+This book documents the different ELF sections used on the Linux kernel.
+We start off by providing references to how ELF was standardized, references
+to the standards on ELF sections, review limitations of ELF sections, and
+finally how Linux uses ELF sections in the Linux kernel. Certain important
+Linux ELF sections are documented carefully: we describe the goal of the
+ELF section, and address concurrency considerations when applicable. A few
+common a set of Linux helpers for ELF sections are also documented.

+ * ``arch/$(ARCH)/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S``.  Architecture Linux linker scripts in
+ * turn include and use definitions from ``include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h``,
+ * as well as some helpers documented in this chapter.
+ *
+ * In assembly it is common practice to use dots (``.``) in labels to avoid
+ * clashes with C symbols. Similarly, a dot (``.``) can be part of a section
+ * name but not a C symbol. Historically then, two dots are used (``..``)

+ * DOC: Initcall levels
+ *
+ * When Linux boots the kernel do_initcalls() iterates over each Linux
+ * initialization level ID and calls all routines embedded on each level ID.
+ * Prior to v2.5.2.3 Linux had only one init level onto which all init
+ * functions folded onto using __initcall(). After v2.5.2.4 Linux split up
+ * initcalls into 7 separate initcall subsection levels, each level describing
+ * different functionality part of the kernel (commit `9d6ba121b7e17085`_
+ * (v2.5.2.3 -> v2.5.2.4)). In order to remain backward compatible __initcall()
+ * calls were left mapped to device_initcall().
+ *
+ * Each init level consists of a dedicated ELF section, init functions are
+ * associated to an init level by linking it into the respective level's
+ * ELF section.
+ *
+ * Lower order init levels run prior to higher order init levels. Ordering
+ * inside each initcall level is determined by respective link order.
+ *

+/**
+ * __define_initcall - wrapper for defining init levels
  *
- * The `id' arg to __define_initcall() is needed so that multiple initcalls
- * can point at the same handler without causing duplicate-symbol build errors.
+ * @fn: init routine
+ * @id: init level
  *
- * Initcalls are run by placing pointers in initcall sections that the
- * kernel iterates at runtime. The linker can do dead code / data elimination
- * and remove that completely, so the initcall sections have to be marked
- * as KEEP() in the linker script.
+ * Defines a kernel initialization level. A respective linker script entry
+ * is required to ensure the init level is accounted for and to ensure symbols
+ * exist for iterating over all functions in the init level. A init level
+ * represents a series of functionality in the kernel.
+ *
+ * Ordering within an initialization level is determined by link order, so
+ * for instance if a Makefile had::
+ *
+ *	obj-y += foo.o
+ *	obj-y += bar.o
+ *
+ * And foo.c::
+ *
+ *	subsys_initcall(foo_init);
+ *
+ * And bar.c had::
+ *
+ *	subsys_initcall(bar_init);
+ *
+ * foo_init() would be called prior to bar_init().
+ *
+ * Note that @id in __define_initcall() also enables multiple initcalls
+ * to be created using the same handler for different init levels without
+ * causing duplicate-symbol build errors.
+ *
+ * Initcalls are run by placing start symbols to initcall levels inside ELF
+ * sections, the kernel in turn uses these symbols to iterate over each init
+ * level at runtime with do_initcall_level(). The end of each init level is
+ * marked by the subsequent symbol's start address until we reach the symbol
+ * ``__initcall_end``. The linker can do dead code / data elimination and each
+ * init level start symbol could be removed completely in this process, to
+ * avoid this each init level start symbols must be marked as 'KEEP()' in the
+ * linker script to avoid any linker optimization heuristic on initcalls.
