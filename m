Right - when writing 0 there before restart, the led value is actually 8
after reboot, and the LED hardware is ON. This holds for both reboot and
halt+poweron cycle.

Maybe this is related to the "#define MAX_BRIGHT 0x07" (which is unused
in samsung-laptop.c)? A bit confusing in the code - but your question
hints for some other bug (to be solved differently). Tell me if I can
help somehow, here.

There is no windows available on this machine.
