Hi Norbert,
there is no problem at all.

Yes I know, and it seems that a device driver is used under Windows... 
can you confirm this? Can you see this sensor under the device listing 
of Windows? Handle 0x0113 might allow to turn on/off this sensor, but 
then it should controlled by another driver, I'm afraid.

I can provide you a patch for testing this feature.

HSC0 returns HGER (Hybrid GFX Event Reason), a number that can be read 
when an Hybrid GFX event is notified (for example when the physical 
switch change its position), telling userspace what triggered that event.

It also provides other informations, do you know their meaning?

Method (HSC1, 0, Serialized)
{
     Store (Zero, Local0)
     If (AVIL)			<-- ??
     { ... }

     If (^^H8EC.SWPS)		<-- switch position
     { ... }

     If (LEqual (HGAP, One))	<-- Hyb GFX A? Presence?
     { ... }

     If (LEqual (HGAP, 0x02))	<-- Hyb GFX A? Presence?
     { ... }

     If (HDME)		<-- HDMI Exit? HDMI routing capability?
     { ... }

     If (DVIE)
     { ... }

     If (^^H8EC.ATSW)		<-- switch set to auto
     { ... }

     ...
}

This is not relevant, we just call the SN07 method from the SNC device, 
so don't care about it.

If I'm not wrong the video driver should take care of calling _DSM and 
other multiplexing methods (MXDS, MXMX and so on), is it right?
We need to find out more about methods HSC1, HSC2, HSC3, HSC4, but I 
don't own the hardware.
Then we can start changing the code to be more compliant to the kernel 
guidelines.
