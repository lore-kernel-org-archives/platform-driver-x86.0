Thanks for confirmation, but it circles back to the question
how to map the numbers.  Since the document that describes it
is not public, it would be useful if you could add comments
to pinctrl-cherryview.c that describes it.
Or did I just miss something?

I'm confused again because I thought "Control Method Power Button (V1) : 0"
means it is a fixed power button, however the DSDT also has

        Device (PWRB)
        {
            Name (_HID, EisaId ("PNP0C0C") /* Power Button Device */)  // _HID: Hardware ID
        }

        Device (SLPB)
        {
            Name (_HID, EisaId ("PNP0C0E") /* Sleep Button Device */)  // _HID: Hardware ID
        }

I had CONFIG_ACPI_I2C_OPREGION=y but excluded CONFIG_MFD_AXP20X
based on \_SB.PIC0.I2C7.PMI1._STA returning 0 in acpidbg,

            Device (PMI1)
            {
                Name (_ADR, Zero)  // _ADR: Address
                Name (_HID, "INT33F4" /* XPOWER PMIC Controller */)  // _HID: Hardware ID
                Name (_CID, "INT33F4" /* XPOWER PMIC Controller */)  // _CID: Compatible ID
                Name (_DDN, "XPOWER PMIC Controller")  // _DDN: DOS Device Name

but \_SB.PIC0.I2C7.PMI1._STA returns 0xf

            Device (PMI2)
            {
                Name (_ADR, Zero)  // _ADR: Address
                Name (_HID, "INT33F5" /* TI PMIC Controller */)  // _HID: Hardware ID
                Name (_CID, "INT33F5" /* TI PMIC Controller */)  // _CID: Compatible ID
                Name (_DDN, "TI PMIC Controller")  // _DDN: DOS Device Name

So I tried CONFIG_MFD_AXP20X=y anyway, but as expected: no change.

Since TI doesn't even have a product page for the SND9039
(only a few references in TI support forum can be found),
I'm not sure what can be done.  So maybe a better short term
goal would be to get wakeup by LID working.

However, I still wonder why the power button can trigger
a thermal irq, is it related to the PMIC?  I couldn't
find out where the thermal irq is routed.


Thanks,
Johannes
