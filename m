I've received a bug report from a user that the touchpad control part
of the ideapad-laptop ACPI interface does work for him on his
"Lenovo Yoga 2 13", and that this patch causes a regression for him.

Since it did not work for me when I had a "Lenovo Yoga 2 11" in my own
hands (loaned from a friend). It seems that this is a bit of hit and miss.

Since the result of having a false positive here is worse, then the minor
annoyance of a false touchpad disabled messages being shown after suspend /
resume on models (or is it firmware versions?) where the interface does not
work, simply revert the patch.

This reverts commit f79a901331a823ae370584b15cd39dd110b95a0a.
