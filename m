Indeed, I hate myself for this :-)

Here was my rationale, feel free to pick it apart:

1) I need time, possibly a couple of months, to get proper ACPI support
for these drivers into the firmware. Then I can rewrite these as ACPI
drivers as is proper for an x86 board. I've already started down this
path.

2) I felt the value of getting something upstream, even if it isn't
perfect, before the board ships was preferable to only having it in
what is effectively a vendor tree (linux-yocto_3.8 standard/minnow) and
risking various other implementations popping up and confusing the
situation.

3) I at least wanted to fix the pch_gbe support which is currently tied
up with these platform drivers. I considered pushing the
minnow_phy_reset into pch_gbe, but I previously was scolded for putting
too much board-specific knowledge into that driver.

Nod, see above. If this trumps the rationale above, it might just make
sense to push the phy reset into the pch_gbe driver and hold off on
these. Alternatively, we can choose to accept that this is transitional
with the understanding that drivers/platform/x86/minnow* *will* go
away.

Oh dear, not something I've experienced. OK, I'll go look into how to
properly handle that case. Any pointers?

OK, can do.

I had them together initially. The reason I broke them up was to
separate fixed functionality from example code. minnowboard.c sets up
the API and any fixed things, like the GPIO LEDs. Those can be easily
configured through LED triggers, so no need to allow for a different
kind of driver.

minnowboard-gpio.c provides easy user access to the GPIO, but would
conflict with a properly written driver for a device driven with the
GPIO. This one is for prototyping and experimentation, but shouldn't be
considered as a "permanent" driver like minnowboard.c is.

minnowboard-keys.c is example code and could possibly be considered a
"permanent" driver once the ACPI version makes it a bit more
configurable by specifying the key codes and such outside the kernel
driver.

minnow_detect() can be replaced with DMI_MATCH() anywhere, so perhaps
this should just go away once the drivers are ACPI'ified.

minnow_lvds_detect().... that's a long story. I only really need it in
minnowboard-gpio.c to make sure I only export the GPIO if they are not
being used for LVDS. I could move it to that driver and remove the
export altogether.

Ethernet, yes.

I bike-shed'ed this until I was blue and decided I should leave it up
to David Miller as he was likely to have an opinion on consolidation of
functionality versus board-agnostic code.

David, would you prefer I set the GPIO from the PCI Subsystem ID and
move the reset function into the pch_gbe driver?

Shiny. Can do. Thanks.

See what happens when core kernel people are allowed to write driver
code? How does this relate to converting this over to an ACPI device
driver? I guess I would replace the above with
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(acpi, ...) ? If I do the above.... is this still an
evil board-file? What makes the acpi method of discover superior to
setting up linux-hotplug via dmi?

I think there is precious piece of learning to be had here (for me I
mean)...

Good point. I'll address in V2 after we bat around some of the above a
bit.

Thank you for taking the time Olof!
