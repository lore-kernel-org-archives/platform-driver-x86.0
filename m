However it *is* for use on ACPI platforms and is impacting power
management (which is something ACPI definitely models) so should be
being documented in an ASWG spec.  We don't want Linux systems to start
breaking the ACPI power management model with uncontrolled extensions,
it's fine to add new bindings for things where there's just no ACPI
specification at all but power management isn't one of those areas.

The idiomatic thing to do on an ACPI system at present appears to be to
have a big DMI quirk table somewhere that instantiates the regulators
and mappings required for them based on the machine's DMI data.  Or if
it's a self contained PCI device or something with both regulator and
consumer do it as part of the subfunction instantiation there.
