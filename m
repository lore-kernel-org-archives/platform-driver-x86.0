Hi Taku,

A few things to keep in mind.

1) Always Cc the maintainer using the email address in the MAINTAINERS file,
   in this case, dvhart at infradead.org.

2) See Documentation/email-clients.txt regarding charset (you sent ISO-2022,JP):

   Email clients should not modify the character set encoding of the text.
   Emailed patches should be in ASCII or UTF-8 encoding only.
   If you configure your email client to send emails with UTF-8 encoding,
   you avoid some possible charset problems.

3) A new driver should be functional at each patch point, so committing a
   skeleton that does nothing is not what we're looking for by "small functional
   changes".

Thanks,
