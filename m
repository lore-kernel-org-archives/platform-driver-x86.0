Right, this was the distinction I was trying to make with the above description.
Henrique's points are valid, but based on the sysfs subsystem already using EIO
in the way that it does, I felt the above made sense.

That said, I'm not personally tied to them, it's just what I have derived from
recent discussions on the subject and what I observed in existing usage.
