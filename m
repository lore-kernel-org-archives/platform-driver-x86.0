The first patch, although it is an i2c-core change, is really
quite simple. I believe anyone can review it. But it does need
someone other then me to take a proper look (and not just do
a code only review) because it is a core change. Maybe there
is another way to solve the problem (persistent / predictable
device-names for i2c devices instantiated through board-data),
but I don't think so.

Also note this is all kernel internal stuff, so we can always
change it later. Although it would be better to get it right in
one go.

Regards,

Hans
