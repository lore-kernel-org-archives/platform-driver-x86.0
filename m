Not only this, the useless churn for no benefit to anyone, except some
*theoretical* cases no one saw.

I will.

The API has been introduced back in 2012.

So, you are insisting that 6.5 years of use in a way people are using
it is wrong?

I don't know what might change your mind, but for me it's a clear
win-win to switch to deferred probe error code based on the
*practical* evidence.
But as I said, I gave up now.

P.S. I still disagree with your arguments in relation to de facto use of an=
 API.
