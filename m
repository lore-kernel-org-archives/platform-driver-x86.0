Like you said, we fell into the trap:

=46ail case:

linux-uy92:/proc/bus/input # vi devices

I: Bus=3D0011 Vendor=3D0001 Product=3D0001 Version=3Dab41
N: Name=3D"AT Translated Set 2 keyboard"
P: Phys=3Disa0060/serio0/input0
S: Sysfs=3D/devices/platform/i8042/serio0/input/input0
U: Uniq=3D
H: Handlers=3Dsysrq kbd event0
B: PROP=3D0
B: EV=3D120013
B: KEY=3D10000 c0200 0 0 0 0 0 700f 2000003 3803078 f830f401 febfffdf f=
fefffff ffffffff fffffffe
B: MSC=3D10
B: LED=3D7


Success case:

linux-uy92:/proc/bus/input # vi devices=20

I: Bus=3D0011 Vendor=3D0001 Product=3D0001 Version=3Dab41
N: Name=3D"AT Translated Set 2 keyboard"
P: Phys=3Disa0060/serio0/input0
S: Sysfs=3D/devices/platform/i8042/serio0/input/input0
U: Uniq=3D
H: Handlers=3Dsysrq kbd event0 rfkill
B: PROP=3D0
B: EV=3D120013
B: KEY=3D10000 c0200 0 0 0 0 0 700f 2000003 3803078 f830f401 febfffdf f=
fefffff ffffffff fffffffe
B: MSC=3D10
B: LED=3D7


In fail case, rfkill didn't register to keyboard's Handlers. And, I als=
o
checked the rfkill-input's .connect didn't call by input when system
boot:

=46ail case:

[    7.144252] rfkill: rfkill_handler_init
[    7.144277] rfkill: rfkill_handler_init, start input_register_handle=
r


Success case:

[    7.580683] rfkill: rfkill_handler_init
[    7.580714] rfkill: rfkill_handler_init, start input_register_handle=
r
[    7.580737] rfkill: doing input_register_handle

Yes,
this a race condition for rfkill-input register before udev set
Acer-specific keymap.=20

We didn't find it just because old acer-wmi driver hide the BIOS defaul=
t
devices states and always set bluetooth state to enabled when system
boot.


Thank's
