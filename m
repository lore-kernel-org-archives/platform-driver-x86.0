I'll fix this for minnow_phy_reset() by moving the reset routine into
the pch_gbe driver and have it request the GPIO, using the pci_id
structure to determine the GPIO line.

I'll drop minnow_lvds_detect() and work toward the firmware managing
this aspect instead.

minnow_detect() doesn't access GPIO.

minnow_hwid() just returns an int that the minnowboard platform driver
read from the GPIO. This seems like a proper abstraction to me. Do you
object to this one as well?

Understood. Since minnow_hwid() is not currently used anywhere anyway,
I'll take Olof's advice and just drop it. We can always add it back if
it becomes necessary.

The only one that remains is pch_gbe and we have a PCI Subsystem ID
there that we can use. Once we determine it is a MinnowBoard, we can
look the GPIO up by chip and offset. If this changes in future board
revs, we'll need minnow_hwid(), or we'll have to figure something out
either in the PCI config space or via ACPI as you suggested.

Thanks Linus, appreciate all the feedback.
