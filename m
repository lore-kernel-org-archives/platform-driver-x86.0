The Linux kernel tree currently contains two Dell laptop-related driver=
s
issuing SMBIOS requests in different ways (dell-laptop in
drivers/platform/x86 and dell-led in drivers/led).  As an upcoming patc=
h
series for the dell-wmi driver (also in drivers/platform/x86) will
change it so that it also performs SMBIOS requests, I took the
opportunity to unify the API used for issuing Dell SMBIOS requests
throughout the kernel before any further code duplication happens.
Credit for suggesting this goes to Pali Roh=C3=A1r.

This patch series is primarily intended for the platform-x86 subsystem,
with only 2 final patches touching the LED subsystem.  I decided to sen=
d
the whole series to everyone involved to provide context - my apologies
if this is frowned upon.

As for making dell-led dependent on a driver in drivers/platform/x86,
let me just hint that Pali and I think it could be possible to
eventually move all of dell-led's code to drivers/platform/x86.  But
first things first.

The first patch generates a lot of checkpatch warnings, but these are
also raised for the original code and I decided that not changing the
code while moving around large quantities of it is critical for
reviewability.

Alex, as I don't have the hardware to test the changes in dell-led
(beyond compilation) and you contributed the parts of it which this
patch series changes, is there any way you might test it on relevant
hardware?
