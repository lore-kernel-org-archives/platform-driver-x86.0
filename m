I was just checking if we needed to credit another individual with code
authorship.

OK, that's non-obvious, so let's add a comment.

So, both lo and hi don't need to be non-zero then, either one being non-zero
would constitute "enabled"? Should the above test be an || then?

OK, let's add a comment to that effect.
