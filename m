IMHO this patches are worthwhile to have by themselves, as said
they fix various inconsistencies, which is a good thing to fix
regardless.

I think that these going into 4.2, and the cleanup which depends on them
(but is other then that pretty much an orthogonal patch set) going into
4.3 is actually a good thing, because if people then experience any
problems due to my work on this, we can easily see if it is due to
the behavior change these 3 patches may introduce in some cases, or
if it is due to the actual cleanup causing a behavior change (which it
should not).

Regards,

Hans
