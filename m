I'm wondering if there is a need for this to be a platform driver at
all. Could we, instead, tear down any unlocked IMRs at boot as part of the IMR
driver itself, as well as lock the kernel .text. Firmware has the option of
making an IMR mandatory by locking it. If it isn't locked, what use is it to the
OS without a lot more context? Any sort of policy enforced with IMRs is a
user-space decision, so clearing out the unlocked ones and then handing off to
user-space seems like a sane default mode to me.

I discussed this with Boon Leong this afternoon and we couldn't come up with a
justification for a platform-specific driver to do what this does.

Cc'ing Mel for his thoughts on the VM bit.
Cc'ing Matthew for his take on platform driver appropriateness.
