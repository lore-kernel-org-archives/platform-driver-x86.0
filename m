Captured acpidumps for all three configurations. Your hunch was right 
that the IVRS table is still created with AmdVt disabled, but it is not 
identical - and the difference looks like the actual mechanism.

Summary, all with the IOMMU enabled and 24 CPUs online:

   config          IVinfo      IVRS len   IVMDs   MSFT0201 in IVRS 
MSFT0201 ACPI dev   SSDTs
   both enabled    0x00203043  0x216      3       yes                yes 
                 29
   AmdVt off       0x00203041  0x1F6      2       yes                yes 
                 29
   Pluton off      0x00203043  0x216      3       yes                NO 
                 28

AmdVt off changes two things. The IVinfo word loses bit 0x2, the 
DmaRemap bit you already parse at offset 36. And the table is 32 bytes 
shorter because one IVMD disappears:

   both enabled:
     IVMD DeviceId=0060 Flags=07 Start=0x7D900000 Len=0x100000
     IVMD DeviceId=C507 Flags=08 Start=0x6B400000 Len=0x20000
     IVMD DeviceId=C100 Flags=08 Start=0x6B1F5000 Len=0x28000

   AmdVt off:
     IVMD DeviceId=C507 Flags=08 Start=0x6B400000 Len=0x20000
     IVMD DeviceId=C100 Flags=08 Start=0x6B1F5000 Len=0x28000

DeviceId 0x0060 is MSFT0201:

   AMD-Vi: ivrs, add hid:MSFT0201, uid:1, rdevid:0x60

and Flags 0x07 is unity mapped with read and write. So disabling AMD 
virtualization removes Pluton's unity mapped DMA region from IVRS, while 
the device is still declared in IVRS, still present as an ACPI device, 
and still attached to iommu group 0:

   platform MSFT0201:00: Adding to iommu group 0

That would leave Pluton's DMA translated with nothing mapped for it, 
which fits every observation: it only breaks with the IOMMU enabled, 
amd_iommu=off is the only thing that fixes it, and neither intremap=off 
nor iommu=pt helps, since iommu=pt gives other devices identity domains 
but the IVMD is how firmware asks for one for this device specifically.

Pluton off is a different failure. The IVRS is byte identical to the 
working case, IVMD 0060 included, but one SSDT is gone and with it the 
MSFT0201 ACPI device. Your existing check already catches that case 
correctly:

   found_iommu=True  found_acpi=False
   -> IOMMU is misconfigured: missing MSFT0201 ACPI device

The AmdVt case is the one that slips through. In check_iommu():

   if not found_ivrs_dmar and not found_ivrs_msft0201:

with AmdVt off, found_ivrs_dmar is False because bit 0x2 is cleared, but 
found_ivrs_msft0201 is True, so the and makes it pass and the tool 
reports "IOMMU properly configured" on a machine that cannot be woken.

So to answer your question about keying off something else: yes, and I 
think the signal is "IVRS declares an ACPI HID device but provides no 
IVMD covering its device id". That needs no vendor attributes and no DMI 
matching. The device id sits 3 bytes before the HID string in the type 
0xF0 entry, and IVMDs are subtable types 0x20/0x21/0x22 with the device 
id at entry offset 4:

   devid = struct.unpack_from("<H", data, data.find(b"MSFT0201") - 3)[0]
   off = 48
   while off + 4 <= len(data):
       length = struct.unpack_from("<H", data, off + 2)[0]
       if length == 0:
           break
       if data[off] in (0x20, 0x21, 0x22):
           if struct.unpack_from("<H", data, off + 4)[0] == devid:
               mapped = True
               break
       off += length

I checked this against all three dumps: it reports mapped for 
both-enabled and Pluton-off, and unmapped for AmdVt-off. Note that it 
would contradict test_check_iommu_no_dma_protection_BUT_msft0201, which 
currently asserts that MSFT0201 in IVRS is an acceptable substitute for 
pre-boot DMA protection, so whether to change that semantic is your call.

I am happy to send you the three acpidumps, with the extracted and 
disassembled tables and a record of the BIOS settings each was taken under.

Beyond that I have to stop here. This has taken the better part of a 
week, a lot of forced power cycles, and around $700 in LLM tokens 
working through it, and I am out of time and energy to take it further. 
The machine works now with AMD virtualization and Pluton enabled, which 
is a perfectly acceptable outcome for me.

Everything I found is in this thread, and I hope the IVRS observation is 
useful to you or to whoever picks it up. Thanks for the help getting 
here - the amd-s2idle tool, the pointer to e9f850ba66cd, and the 
suggestion to reset the BIOS were all what moved it forward.
