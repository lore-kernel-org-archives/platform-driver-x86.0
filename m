Global comment to the series, we agreed with Hans to follow the
pattern for Intel PMIC driver (module / file) names:

intel_XXX_<PLATFORM><PMIC>, where <PLATFORM> is 3 letter encoded Intel
platform name, like cht for CherryTrail and <PMIC> is two letter
abbreviation from ZZZ Cove, like wc for Whiskey Cove.

Here I understand that there is a potential of two PMIC variants for
the same platform DC from Intel, DC from TI. I dunno if former will be
a case in the future, though we may use something like

 intel_XXX_chtdc_ti

for the latter one.
