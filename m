In fact quite a few things involved in this:

since we get notified with VPC bit 13 set when Fn+F5 is pressed, I
think that it is ok to be treated as a hardware rfkill
blocking/unblocking.

However it is true that the bit/event is supposed be to be handled by
an application in Windows, it is a soft-killswitch by the definition.
Yet currently there is no such correspondent userspace app/daemon as I
know. This inspired the original intention of the patch, to handle the
app-controlled rfkill in the driver. I think that this is probably
common in other platform-x86 drivers.

I'd rather agree with you that it is a better idea to report a keycode.
