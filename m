The problem, as I've mentioned in previous discussions we had about
this, is that, as you've seen in replies to this mail, this would
suddenly be making the kernel apply policy.

There's going to be pushback as soon as policy is enacted in the
kernel, and you take away the different knobs for individual components
(or you can control them centrally as well as individually). As much as
I hate the quantity of knobs[1], I don't think that trying to reduce
the number of knobs in the kernel is a good use of our time, and easier
to enact, coordinated with design targets, in user-space.

Unless you can think of a way to implement this kernel wide setting
without adding one more exponent on the number of possibilities for the
testing matrix, I'll +1 Hans' original API.

Cheers
