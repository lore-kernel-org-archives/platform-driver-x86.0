Correct.

That is a good question, this really started with the micro-usb
otg stuff, where we have more or less the same problem in a much
simpler way:

1) We have a cable plugged in which determined if we should mux the
usb2 data lines on a micro-usb to an usb-host or an usb-device/gadget
controller.

2) Some way to detect the type of cable plugged in

3) A hardware block or dedicated chip which is independent from 2,
which needs to be controlled by the code implementing 2.

So we need some glue layer with an abstract (device independent)
interface between 2 and 3 so that we can plug random combinations
of 2 and 3 together. In the beginning I tried using the extcon
framework for that, but that is not really a good fit.

Then someone else did some patches for the otg-mux found on the
Intel Cherry Trail block where using the mux subsys for this and
that seemed like a good idea to me.

And sofar I must say that from my pov the mux subsys does work
quite well for this, but now that I better understand the initial
design of the mux subsys I can understand that you are reluctant
about my use case.

Correct, the TCPM code is generic and for example the Cherry Trail
SoC OTG mux needs to be controller by either:

A) Something which is detecting the type of cable connected to a
micro-usb (either a PMIC or a gpio reading the ID pin) on devices
with a micro-usb connecter; or

B) The TCPM code on devices with a Type-C connector.

So this is another example where the mux-subsys more or less is
a pretty good fit.

As for the locking, you're right that the locking is not necessary,
but the Type-C connector and its muxes have a clearly defined idle
state, so the deselect functionality also is a decent fit there.

See the above example about 2 completely different ways how we
need to control the Cherry Trail SoC OTG mux. We really need some
sort of abstraction layer here, and then some way to hook the TCPM
and the Type-C and OTG-mux together, either through pnode handles
in DT on DT platforms or through something like the lookup table
code one of my patches add on x86.

For me using the mux subsys for this works well. But as said I
can understand you being reluctant. Alternatively we could add a
new usb_mux subsys for this I guess.

Hans
