Oh boy, that must be the second time in a decade that I see that
codepath triggering.  It is the second-level alert that the ThinkPad is
about to catch fire.

It should have logged a "is too hot!" first-level alert earlier, but
this depends on the EC and not the driver.  Maybe the temperature raised
too fast.

In Windows, the system would attempt to hibernate or shutdown.  I would
be quite happy to have thinkpad-acpi trigger such behavior as well,
patches (or guidance) are welcome ;-)

Anyway, if that temperature goes about 1~2°C higher, the EC should cut
power to your motherboard.  Apparently, the built-in thermal protection
clock modulation on the Intel processor is somehow saving your box from
that forced power-off.
