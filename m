Yeah, 644 is "clear", but _RW() is even more clear.  Ideally I want to
get rid of all of the "non-standard" users that set random modes of

much better.

Why you didn't send that patch to the sysfs maintainer is a bit odd...  :)

I should be taking this whole series through my tree.  Joe, thanks for
doing this in an automated way, I've been wanting to see this done for a
long time.

thanks,
