Bearing in mind that most of those keys won't be usable in X11, but
should be in Wayland, it might take a little while to actually get used,
but I would add support for this "clipping tool" key in GNOME. Most
likely to start a screenshoting tool in selection mode.

The button actually looks like a Cloud, see page 46 of this guide:
http://www.lenovo.com/shop/americas/content/user_guides/x1carbon_2_ug_en.pdf

In GNOME, I would make this start the "Online Accounts" configuration.
I'm fine with renaming it, but I would prefer something more precise
than KEY_VENDOR. KEY_WWW would be fine by me.

This wouldn't get used directly in GNOME.

This would get used.

Those would get used as well.

These 2 wouldn't get used directly in GNOME.

Answers to this in-line above. I'm fine with replacing the keycodes for
those keys with something that more or less corresponds to the
pictograms, especially the "Toggle voice-recognition" and "Toggle
camera-gestures function" are present in all the keyboard modes.

Cheers
