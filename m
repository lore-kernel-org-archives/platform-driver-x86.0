There was compilation bug in bmf2mof, which caused that bmf2mof show
same output as bmfparse. Now it is fixed in git and bmf2mof really
outputs real MOF text document (UTF-8 encoded, unlike windows which
produce UTF-16).

So if you are going to play with it, pull changes, run make clean and
then make again.

If we are going to move bmof into debugfs, then it means bmof is only
for debugging purpose.

But we already had discussion that MOF supports should be in userspace,
therefore reading bmof should be in /sys (or /dev or whatever is normal
or stable for userspace).

On the other hand if we want to parse bmof in kernel and do all
validation (which IIRC is doing also Windows kernel) before calling
"random" AML function from userspace, then it is probably good idea to
put bmof only in debugfs.

This has one big problem. Lot of times you want to show/parse WMI data
from other computer (E.g. user send dumps via email and then somebody
else parse them). Having parsed data in /sys is quite hard to pack again
into same _WDG buffer.

Plus most existing tools want to parse _WDG buffer on its own and
provide parsed information on output.

Here debugs for _WDG could make sense as by default it should not be
needed for userspace, but it is really useful for debugging or writing
new (or fixing existing) wmi kernel driver.

MOF describe C++ like object system and for particular structures or
methods there is GUID and WMI id.

When you want to call WMI function implemented in ACPI you need to know:
* name of ACPI function
* instance number
* WMI id
* structure of input buffer

Name of ACPI function is taken from _WDG where is mapping from GUID to
object_id and ACPI function consist of well-known prefix and object_id
as a suffix. GUID is present in MOF. Where to get correct instance
number is still question for me. WMI id and structure of input buffer is
described in MOF.
