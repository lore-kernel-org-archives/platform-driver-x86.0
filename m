Odds are, the windows driver just isn't even loaded on the newer
machines, as ACPI works just fine for this.  But, we don't have the
option of shipping custom systems for different laptops like Samsung
does, so we have to probe for this somehow.

Initally we were looking at the DMI strings for specific laptop models,
but that got annoying as we had to keep adding new models.  So we now
just check the memory locations for all Samsung laptops, which was
working fine.

What is the problem if we try to access this memory on UEFI machines?
What is the error that is caused?

Is there any "this_is_a_uefi_system()" type call drivers can make to
just opt-out if that call is true?

thanks,
