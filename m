Thos macros basically do the same stuff I do manually. I think that most
of the kernel does errors on a non-0 basis, and ACPI is no exception.

That being said, I think that using a simple non-0 check if more clean
than using those macros.

Isn't this:

if (!acpi_eval....

nicer than this?

if ACPI_FAILURE(acpi_eval...

It just adds more stuff to get wrong. And I don't really think that the 
ACPI implementation will change those macros anytime soon, or ever.

Keeping it simple.

Techically, I'm not adding a device this I did not use those macros. I'm
only adding more attributes to a device that the battery module manages.
