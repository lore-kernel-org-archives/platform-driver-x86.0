M... We all know the wmi spec is from Microsoft and OEM/ODM base on it
to write their wmi function spec for develop their windows solution.
So, I thought we still need to reference the behavior on windows then d=
o
our desicion on Linux.

Especially Linux kernel response BIOS by _OSI said we are Windows OS.

I will check when they start to use wmi event to replace the scancode o=
r
maybe Acer ship wmi with different notebook family.
My 0001 patch transfer the wmi event to keycode, so, rfkill-input can
catch the keycode to work.

I agreed Dmitry's suggestion, we just direct enable the launch manager
mode to stop EC touch RF switch. Either use rfkill-input or userland
daemon to control the RF switch, we all need disable the default EC
behavior, it causes sometimes will enable/disalbe wifi/bluetooth switch
twice.

Thank's for your suggestion, I will try to check your question.

Like the above, I thought we just direct enable the lanuch manager mode
when acer-wmi driver detected the WMID3 available.


Thank's
