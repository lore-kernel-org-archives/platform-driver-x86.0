Generally speaking yeah a positive answer (ASUSTEK ...) means
the feature is supported. A negative answer (generally 0xFF 0xFF 0x00 ....)
means the feature is not supported.

Those messages are also an init for models that supports the feature,
and generally asus has hooked functions not directly connected
to the main function of the endpoint to those handshakes
(the only example on my mind is 5a [] making some fn keys behaving
different than booting/pre-os, basically for UEFI settings I guess).

The disassembled AsusKeyboardFilter.sys seems to call those regardless,
but a list of devices is nowhere to be found, probably because the .inf
already lists the vid and pid for the driver to load.

Perhaps, I can't find it on my notes. In general keyboard configuration
has been scattered on a lot of "devices": certain laptops have an additional
i2c device, that is separate from the keyboard device, that  does things
like locking certain keys... don't be surprised if one command
does more than what you are used to.

On the ally 5a also changes gamepad configuration, not just leds
as usual.

Before the bootloader if you press the vol+ a boot menu will appear
and the device will enter keyboard mode (ASUS implemented this to
allow easier UEFI usage), but as soon as you init the device [5a handshake]
it re-enters its default state (xbox360), exiting the keyboard state.

Given that those devices are the main way to control the hardware
(for things that are out of scope of wmi) you could also call those
_SYSTEM or something that denotate the importance of those devices
in controlling what the firmware does.

I am fine even with what Ilpo suggested, I simply don't want
to associate those vid:pid with something that is necessarily
"old" as they have been in use for a long time and at least on ROG
virtually all of them have those vid:pid...

The overwhelming majority: so much so that the easiest way to
tell models apart is to check for DMI since software cannot easily
distinguish them from USB alone.
