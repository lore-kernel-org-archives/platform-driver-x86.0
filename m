Looking at your dsdt:

BUF1 and BUF2 contains some easy to find data:

                        CreateByteField (BUF1, 0x01, EID1)

Looking at _INI :
       Store (\_SB.BRNS, BRMX) probably means "set the brightness to
the maximum brightness"

WQIO returns both BUF1 and BUF2, you can get it with wmi_query_block()

WSIO calls CPSR and CPSR store the argument in INBF.
BY00, BY01, ... BY31, BGTX, BGTY, BGTZ etc ... are used to access
specific bytes in INBF :
                        CreateByteField (INBF, 0x00, BY00)
                        CreateByteField (INBF, 0x01, BY01)
                        CreateByteField (INBF, 0x02, BY02)
                        CreateByteField (INBF, 0x03, BY03)
                        CreateByteField (INBF, 0x04, BY04)
                        CreateByteField (INBF, 0x05, BY05)


CSPR wants BY00 to be 0x01 and BY01 to be 0x10 to do something.
It calls CMD0 (BY08, BY09, BY10, BY11, BY16)

ERQ0 (present in BUF1) is compared to Arg2 (BY09) == 0x1
if true, it will store some values and call notify
