The entire file assumes a valid toshiba_acpi_dev. If this is a problem, it needs a separate patch to address it. So, let's drop this change, update the commit log to match the new sysfs filenames, and this should be ready to go.

Ok, I'll leave this function as it is for this patch. I'll send an updated
(and hopefuly final) patch.

I have some "cleanup" changes comming, so that might be a good
place for them.
