Hello, thank you very much for testing.

If there is problem with my patch series which does not reflect=20
correct state after resume from S3, I can add pm hook which will=20
try to re-read rfkill state (via GRBT) after system wake up from=20
S3.

It comes from i8042 bus via internal AT keyboard (not from WMI).=20
In userspace you can assign correct keycode (e.g. KEY_WLAN or=20
KEY_RFKILL) so it does not show as unknown. Its scancode is 136=20
(0x88) and default keycode 240 (0xF0).

Some other distributions or other software automatically map this=20
unknown 240 keycode to some key, so you will see duplicate event=20
even in X applications.

I would suggest you to use program input-events for reading=20
pressed keys as it show all key events from kernel and it is=20
working per input device (so it is possible to check if event=20
comes from AT keyboard, WMI or other driver). If there is problem=20
with WMI driver (it reports both key press and BIOS do some=20
change) we can patch WMI driver to prevent another looping=20
problem...

How it change BIOS behaviour?

Next I would suggest you to test clean system without fanny=20
software like NetworkManager. Previously we saw that=20
NetworkManager change state of network devices and rfkill=20
softstates so it can interact with kernel. I think that new=20
driver in kernel should work also without NetworkManager and also=20
there are people who use alternative software (and not=20
NetworkManager). I know that Ubuntu has installed & enabled=20
NetworkManager by default, so some results in your table could=20
have values changed by NetworkManager and not by kernel.

And I have one question: Does Inspirion 5721 have ACPI DELRBTN=20
device (instead DELLABCE).
