My preference would be to expose everything found in _WDG across platforms =
so it=20
doesn't have to be a whitelist.  DMI matching could work if it was done spe=
cifically
on the manufacturer rather than individual system.

If you compare to how it's done with the other OS, everything mentioned in =
the MOF
is accessible from userspace.  The only reason the MOF exists is to match u=
p
what's in _WDG.  Linux can make this actually easier in that you just don't=
 use the
MOF at all.

They're going to be changing in the future and that will use a new WMI inte=
rface
when that change happens.

The interfaces don't routinely change today, but there discussions to chang=
e
and introduce more later.

The intent is for production, so that remediation tools can run on the box.
