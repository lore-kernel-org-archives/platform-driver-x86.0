I've a weak preference for consistency, but not at the expense of
hundreds of patches churning the kernel to remove an innocuous macro.
Churn costs time and effort.

In this case, I don't think it does that much ... a cut and paste eithe=
r
way (from a macro or non-macro based driver) yields correct code.  Sinc=
e
there's no bug here and no apparent way to misuse the macro, why bother=
?

Anyway, it's PCI code ... let the PCI maintainer decide.  However, if h=
e
does want this do it as one big bang patch via either the PCI or Trivia=
l
tree (latter because Ji=C5=99=C3=AD has experience doing this, but the =
former
might be useful so the decider feels the pain ...)
