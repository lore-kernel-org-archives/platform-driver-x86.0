Yeah, we can add it to the X evdev map. That's not a problem. The only 
problem I see is that we don't have a good semantic definition - some 
machines send a toggle keycode, whereas others send on/off. That 
wouldn't in itself be a problem, but sometimes that's accompanied by the 
touchpad being disabled by the BIOS. In the latter case we probably 
don't want to map it, since the BIOS can do it anyway, but there's an 
argument that we need some way to expose that to userspace.
