Just to note, that there is only press key event with scancode=20
136 (0x88). Release event is not sent to AT keyboard which cause=20
problems (if you map this scancode to some well known keycode).

Alex, but I wrote you about this problem (in private email which=20
you forwarded) together with other bios/fw problems for latitude=20
machines...

Anyway I sent email to Matthew Garrett before Christmas and linux=20
kernel could generate proper release event by fixing commit=20
61579ba83934d397a4fa2bb7372de9ae112587d5 (adding also 9 and 10 to=20
chassis_type). I believe Matthew Garrett will kernel provide=20
workaround until Dell fix their BIOSes...
