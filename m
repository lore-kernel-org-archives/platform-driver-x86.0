If request_firmware_into_buf() is used and the firmware was found in
/lib/firmware/ paths then the driver will *not* use the firmware prior
to any LSM doing any firmware signature verification because
kernel_read_file_from_path() and in turn security_kernel_read_file().

The firmware API has a fallback mechanism [0] though, and if that is used t=
hen
security_kernel_post_read_file() is used once the firmware is loaded through
the sysfs interface *prior* to handing the firmware data to the driver. As
Hans noted though security_kernel_post_read_file() currently *only* uses
READING_FIRMWARE, so this needs to be fixed. Also note though that LSMs
get a hint of what is going to happen *soon* prior to the fallback
mechanism kicking on as we travere the /lib/firmware/ paths for direct
filesystem loading.

If this is not sufficient to cover LSM appraisals *one* option could be to
have security_kernel_read_file() return a special error of some sort
for READING_FIRMWARE_PREALLOC_BUFFER so that kernel_read_file_from_path()
users could *know* to fatally give up.

Currently the device drivers using request_firmware_into_buf() can end up
getting the buffer with firmware stashed in it without having the kernel do=
 any
firmware signature verification at all through its LSMs. The LSM hooks adde=
d to
the firmware loader long ago by Kees via commit 6593d9245bc66 ("firmware_cl=
ass:
perform new LSM checks") on v3.17 added an LSM for direct filesystem lookup=
s,
but on the fallback mechanism seems to have only added a post LSM hook
security_kernel_fw_from_file().

There is also a custom fallback mechanism [1] which can be used if the path=
 to
the firmware may be out of the /lib/firmware/ paths or perhaps the firmware
requires some very custom fetching of some sort. The only thing this does
though is just *not* issue a uevent when we don't find the firmware and also
sets the timeout to a practically never-ending value. The custom fallback
mechanism is only usable for request_firmware_nowait() though. In retrospect
the custom fallback mechanism is pure crap and these days we've acknowledged
that even in crazy custom firmware fetching cases folks should be able to
accomplish this by relying on uevents and using the firmwared [2] or forking
it, or a different similar proprietary similar solution, which would just
monitor for uevents for firmware and just Do The Right Thing (TM).

Consider some mobile devices which may want to fetch it from some custom
partition which only it can know how to get.

There is a kernel config option which enables the fallback mechanism always,
This is now easily readable as follows:

drivers/base/firmware_loader/fallback_table.c

struct firmware_fallback_config fw_fallback_config =3D {
	.force_sysfs_fallback =3D IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER_FALLBACK=
),
	.loading_timeout =3D 60,
	.old_timeout =3D 60,
};

Even if this is used we always do direct fs lookups first.

Android became the primary user of CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER_FALLBACK.

It would be good for us to hear from Android folks if their current use of
request_firmware_into_buf() is designed in practice to *never* use the dire=
ct
filesystem firmware loading interface, and always rely instead on the
fallback mechanism.

That would answer help your appraisal question in practice today.

We may need more work for this for request_firmware_into_buf().

Hah, by *definition* the device *and* processor has immediate access
to data written *immediately* when dma_alloc_coherent() is used. From

It will depend on the above question.
