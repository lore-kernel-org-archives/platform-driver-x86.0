Subject: [PATCH v5 3/4] i2c: core: Allow drivers to disable i2c-core irq mapping

By default the i2c-core will try to get an irq with index 0 on ACPI / of
instantiated devices. This is troublesome on some ACPI systems where the
irq info at index 0 in the CRS table may contain nonsense and/or point
to an irqchip for which there is no Linux driver.

If this happens then before this commit the driver's probe method would
never get called because i2c_device_probe will try to get an irq by
calling acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get which will always return -EPROBE in this
case, as it waits for a matching irqchip driver to load. Thus causing
the driver to not get a chance to bind.

This commit adds a new disable_i2c_core_irq_mapping flag to struct
i2c_driver which a driver can set to tell the core to skip irq mapping.

Changes in v2:
-Actually also use the irq_index for of interrupts
Changes in v3:
-Add kernel doc for new i2c_driver irq_index member
-Remove duplicate assignment of driver in i2c_device_probe
Changes in v4:
-Add a disable_i2c_core_irq_mapping flag to i2c_driver instead of
 an irq_index member (effectively a rewrite of the patch, dropped
 the Reviewed-by-s)
