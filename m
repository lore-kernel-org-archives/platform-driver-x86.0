While fairly superficial in nature I think this patch set is worthwhile. 
Features have been progressively added to fujitsu-laptop over the last 10 or
so years from a number of sources but a consistent naming methodology for
constants has not emerged.  Having at least some consistency across the
constant names will help clarify the intent of the code.

Patches 4 and 5 don't bother me within the context of the patch series as a
whole.

As before, I can't see any strong arguments one way or the other.  The
helper functions certainly save a line in many of the call sites, but
whether they provide significant advantages I cannot say (I personally have
no fundamental problems with either version).  I guess if pushed I'd
probably come down on the side of leaving things as they are: in principle
defining a bunch of thin wrapper functions to save one parameter isn't
something I tend to do since it doesn't seem worth it.  However, what has
changed since the last iteration of this idea is the use of identifiers
rather than numbers for many of call_fext_func()'s parameters, which adds
length to each call site.

If there is general agreement that using these functions is beneficial in
this context I certainly won't block it.
