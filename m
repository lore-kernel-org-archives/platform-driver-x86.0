Sounds like the "hp-wifi" soft block status affects "phy0" hard block
status. So if some management program softblocks "hp-wifi", the "phy0"
will become hardblocked and the program doesn't understand that it needs
to unblock "hp-wifi" again to undo what it just did.

I have no idea what is the proper course of action here, though, but
hopefully someone else on the lists has an idea.
