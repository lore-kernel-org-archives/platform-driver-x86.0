Hi there,

Well, I'm just providing the on/off switch on Toshiba specific hardware,
but I'm unaware/unfamiliar with how other vendors implement this
feature.

Sounds good, as not all ports carry such functionality, on my
current laptop only two ports provide this, the other two are just
normal USB 2/3 ports (configurable ;-) ).

If there's an existing API already, I'll be glad to modify the code to
use it, if it doesn't exist yet, I'll simply adapt the code to the chosen
standard whenever becomes available.
