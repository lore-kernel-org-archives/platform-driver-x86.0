I'm not saying we should move it to the userspace.

I'm saying this should be "normal" led. drivers/leds/led-huawei-acpi.c,
or something. Perhaps this acpi stuff is so similar you don't really
need .c code.

And then there should be a "mic muted" trigger. Similar to
drivers/leds/trigger/ledtrig-disk.c.

That should give us the flexibility, and should not be really much
different from current implementation...
