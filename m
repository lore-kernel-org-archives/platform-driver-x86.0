All right, but what about the unknown WMI events? Those are the bigger
problem anyway, as at least one machine (the Latitude XT2) can generate
a lot of these messages for unknown reasons. It doesn't appear that
anyone has been making use of these messages since we still only support
one event. Would you object to demoting that one?
