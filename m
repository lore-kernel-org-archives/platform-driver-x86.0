Have no idea for this _DSM error, need help from drm and acpi experts.

What does Windows platform's behavior? Does there have any physical key
that can turn on/off the second LVDS on Windows?

I will look at your dsdt and log from acer-wmi then try to improve
acer-wmi.

What's the behavior of Windows?
