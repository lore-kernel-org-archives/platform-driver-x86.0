That said, both variants are Linux-ish to me: I do not believe that
"primary slave interrupt" for I2C devices is a generic concept. Is it?
Do BSD and Windows use it?

Also, it matches the paragraph above that also talks about I2C core.

In any case, it is your decision, I'm just making random noise here.

Thanks.
