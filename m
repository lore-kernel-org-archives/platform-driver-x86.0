I don't see any value in trying to rule out specific causes of
INVALID_TOKEN, but we should only retry EINIT if ret==INVALID_TOKEN
and RDMSR(HASH0) != sgx_lepubkeyhash[0].  Only the first MSR needs to
be checked for validity as they're a package deal, i.e. they'll all be
valid or all be reset.  There shouldn't be a limit on retry attempts,
e.g. the MSRs could theoretically be reset between WRMSR and EINIT.
