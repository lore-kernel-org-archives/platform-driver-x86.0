We can set one trigger at a time. In this case it will be impossible
to have hw brightness change notifications while other trigger is
active.

It would report current state. The file called hw_brightness_change
should report last brightness change originating from hardware.
The most recent hw brightness change is still current state from
this perspective. It will be valid until next hw brightness change
occurs.

Current state does not mean current brightness in this case.
