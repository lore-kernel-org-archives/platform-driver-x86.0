Thanks - now let me try to sum this up in order to get it straight (I've been
reading the ACPI spec and had to fight sleep really hard :-).

1. EC detects an event (hotkey), raises an SCI.

2. Linux ec.c driver services the SCI, queries the EC for event code.

3. If available, ec.c calls ACPI _Qxx method for received event code.

4. _Qxx method changes some internal state and MAY again call
   Notify(...) to pass the event to some other ACPI device.

5. If Notify() was called, second-level ACPI driver (e.g. battery.c,
   thermal.c, ...) gets event and handles it accordingly.

If that's correct so far, couldn't I just print the EC event code in
acpi_ec_sync_query and see what it's spitting out on hotkey press?
