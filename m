You're correct, but most of the data fields within BUF1 and BUF2 are
never referenced anywhere else. Doesn't that mean that these fields are
probably dead?

So this would then trigger the WMI event in the driver, right?
I'd assume that EVID is the EVent ID - would make sense, since somewhere
in the embedded controller code, there's this snippet:

	Method (_QEF, 0, NotSerialized)
	{
		Store (0xEF, P80H)
		\_SB.WMI2.CMD2 (0x2D, 0x01, 0x01)
	}

	Method (_QF1, 0, NotSerialized)
	{
		Store (0xF1, P80H)
		\_SB.WMI2.CMD2 (0x2C, 0x01, 0x01)
	}

AFAICT the problem might be that ERQ0 is never initialized.. so it's
probably zero from the start and the first code branch in CMD0 will
never be called.

I've gone through the binary module from Splashtop (lenovo_ec.ko) with
objdump, and it appears that it's calling exactly those methods
(GECN,SECN,DECN). The EC registers themselves also do look very
interesting, especially with fields like XALM/YALM/ZALM or
GSVX/GSVY/GSVZ which are probably related to the accelerometer.

Do you perhaps have some example as to how to access the EC register
space?

Thanks, Florian
