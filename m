As well as some changes require simultaneous changes across
multiple subsystems.

It depends on what you mean by treewide:

If a treewide: patch is applied by some "higher level" maintainer,
then generally, no.

If the treewide patch is also cc'd to many individual maintainers,
then yes, many many times.

Mostly because patches cause what is in their view churn or that
changes are not specific to their subsystem grounds.

The treewide patch is sometimes dropped, sometimes broken up and
generally not completely applied.

What would be useful in many cases like this is for a pre and post
application of the treewide patch to be compiled and the object
code verified for lack of any logic change.

Unfortunately, gcc does not guarantee deterministic compilation so
this isn't feasible with at least gcc.  Does clang guarantee this?

I'm not sure it's possible:
