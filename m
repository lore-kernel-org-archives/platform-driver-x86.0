Keith, thanks for the patch.  It has been shipped in mainline for a while
now.  That V1 postfix means the factory shipped a pre-release BIOS image for
some reason.  That's not a first with Lenovo and ThinkPads.

Notice that all public releases have the WW suffix.

The changelog in that .txt file worries me.  You might really want to update
if you're still at 1.16/1.09.

Anyway, I will add an extra patch to the driver to keep accepting non-WW
firmware, but to alert the user that something is weird and to check for a
BIOS update.  Since that might well still trigger on your box, I thought I
should drop you a direct note.
