the "acpi_" prefix here sounds inappropriate at this point. And
descending from that, shouldn't a mechanism like you describe being
implemented in the backlight subsystem?

I think the whole idea of promote/demote_vendor was to avoid adding
vendor specific quirks to acpi's video code. If it was the right
implementation different story, but it sure sounded like a sensble idea.
We do have platform drivers that know if they should control backlight
or let it do to ACPI or even the native driver. Quirks in the patform
specific code _is_ IMO the right place to have those quirks.

Maybe I'm missing some recent evolution but except for some special
cases, backlight hotkeys generally result in an input event sent to
userspace and it then becomese a userspace problem to choose which
interface to use.

Last, just to add another use case, vaio laptops in specific
configurations require both ACPI and vendor backlight to be registered
as the former will notify the latter to change the backlight rather than
doing it itself. It's explained here (with a potential implementation):
