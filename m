I think so.

It's just a specific driver that provides thermal capability, no need to
move to the core code.

As long as we create the ACPI video backlight interface, we will create
the thermal cooling device. If we somehow knows that the ACPI methods to
adjust the backlight level doesn't work(a good hint is that the
acpi_video_unregister_backlight is called), we should make that cooling
device disappear.
