Why we are not checking if kernel is running on AIO or laptop form
factor then? Or it is not possible?

Basically what I see there is that we need to detect if current HW
platform has switchable graphics and check how is configured AUDIO MUX.

But instead of directly checking hw state of audio MUX, we are trying to
check something different which could get us information of state of the
audio mux.

I suspect that we do not have a way how to check audio MUX directly, so
it needs to be done indirectly -- via some Dell SMBIOS call and some
other heuristic. This is something which should be specified either in
comment or in commit message (problem of type: we need X, but check for
Y).

And if we are doing this check indirectly, we should do the most
specific test and not more general.

I think that PCI vendor ID check of audio device is more general test
then checking if kernel is running on Dell laptop (check via DMI). And
if we can check also if running on AIO or laptop form, then it would be
more specific test.

Right.

I see, this solution is working...

=2E.. but, I see there a very bad precedense. What would happen if another
laptop manufactor comes with similar solution for hybrid graphics. Does
it mean that hda audio driver would try to call for every one vendor its
vendor dependent API function (EFI, SMM, WMI, whatever) to check if
current HW has some switchable graphics and needs special checks?

Those vendor dependent API functions (which Dell SMBIOS is) should be
really called on vendor hardware.

Otherwise audio drivers would load bunch of the other vendor dependent
platform modules and all of those modules (except maximally one) just
return error.

I agree, But see that this patch already uses vendor ID whitelisting.
