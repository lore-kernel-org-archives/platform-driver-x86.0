It's a good question need to check with Old=C5=99ich for his machine.

If talk about my Acer TravelMate 8572, NO! My machine only have wifi
hotkey, but either BIOS/EC raw mode or wmi mode, the key does not emit
any KEY_* keycode.

But, yes, thank's your remind, as I remember, in some Acer consumer
notebook, they also emit scancode when hotkey pressed, like you said,
maybe they emit both wmi event and scancode.

Not on my machine but need check Old=C5=99ich's machine.

Yes, the wmi event is must be a KEY_ event on linux platform, because i=
t
was emited by user press hotkey.

I thought still need time to promote urfkill.

>=20

There have 2 different behavior on Acer BIOS:
 - cold boot (shutdown then power on): BIOS will reset to raw state (WL=
AN on, BT off, WWAN on)
 - warm boot (reboot): BIOS will keep last time's state

I thought still have some engineer will look at kernel document, I will
send patch for add urfkill daemon information to kernel document and ad=
d
Cc. to you for review.


Thank's a lot!
