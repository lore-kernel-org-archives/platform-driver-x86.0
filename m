There is a non-nitpicky consideration here.  Logically, user code is
going to do this (totally made-up pseudocode):

enclave_t enclave = load_and_init_enclave(...);
int ret = sgx_run(enclave, some pointers to non-enclave-memory buffers, ...);

and, with the code in this patch, a correct implementation of
sgx_run() requires installing a signal handler.  This is nasty, since
signal handlers, expecially for something like SIGSEGV or SIGBUS, are
not fantastic to say the least in libraries.

Could we perhaps have a little vDSO entry (or syscall, I suppose) that
runs an enclave an returns an error code, and rig up the #PF handler
to check if the error happened in the vDSO entry and fix it up rather
than sending a signal?

On Windows, this is much less of a concern, because Windows has real
scoped fault handling. But Linux doesn't, at least not yet.
