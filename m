There should really be some Documentation about how to choose an include
directory :-)

My understanding is include/linux should be more generic, rather than platform
specific headers. So while platform_data may refer specifically to the platform
bus drivers, it's the closest thing we have to include/platform, which would be
ideal. I would prefer to stick with include/platform_data because:

1) Semantically, it's the closest thing there is
2) include/linux should be for more generic headers related to the OS or
   subsystems
3) It doesn't make sense to create a separate include/platform directory for a
   single header.
4) We don't want to rename platform_data to platform now and change all the
   drivers, but it could be changed later.

Thomas, do you disagree with any of the above?

Yes, your submission matches the intent from Thomas and I as I understand it.
