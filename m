If we are adding hwdb entries anyway to control the userspace
interpretation of the TOGGLE key, then we could also add the new CYCLE
key and explicitly re-map it to TOGGLE. That requires slightly more
logic in hwdb, but it does mean that we could theoretically just drop
the workaround if we ever stop caring about Xorg.
