I agree that having a way for interested userspace to detect those
would be good, but that would need to be another API, may poll()
on the brightness attribute itself while excluding triggers / blinking
changes from wakeup ?

Anyways that is something to discuss in a thread specific to the
LED subsystem and somewhat orthogonal to this patch.

One disadvantage of poll() is that it does not give the source of
the change, so in retrospect I actually like the new brightness_hw_changed
attribute as that does give the source, which is something which we need
to know in userspace. In previous versions of the ABI I had to do
the same brightness comparison I'm doing in the dell-laptop driver
now in userspace, where it can never be done safely as userspace does
not know about other userspace.

Since the Dell smbios events don't provide us with a source of the
change, we need to compare the brightness to the last set brightness
somewhere and IMHO the kernel is the best (least bad) place to do
that.

Because we cannot solve the smbios-keyboard-ctl case, but we can solve
the echo case, as said we could probably use a new kernel ABI to allow
userspace to detect changes caused by the echo example, but that
really is a whole new discussion.
