Actually the fuel-guage is completely independent, the PI3USB30532 USB
switch will get set based on extcon cable events from the FUSB302 USB
Type-C controller, but otherwise both drivers are independent and the
FUSB302 USB Type-C controller pretty much operates stand-alone.

I think this is really some Windows weirdness, if I configure the BIOS
to boot "Android" the ACPI INT33FE device goes away and instead I
get 3 separate ACPI devices for the 3 chips.
