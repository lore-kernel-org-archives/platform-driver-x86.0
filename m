On the contrary, the "result" parameter is the one being returned by the
modified read/write functions now, and was (and still is) the only one
being checked for support, error, or otherwise, depending on what the
Toshiba method returns.

Cleanup mostly, what's the purpose of returning a value,
if that value is never checked? Better return a value that
indeed is being checked, and contains useful info about
the status of the queried function (such as "not supported")
