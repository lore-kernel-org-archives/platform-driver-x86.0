=46ully understood, now.

Like you siad, we need define a policy for:

 - If user want the default "raw" behavior, what do they need to do?
	I thought if the wmi driver doesn't load by default, then user=20
       will get a "raw" behavior.

 - If any distro want provide userland solution, how can they disable=20
   the default "raw" behavior?
	If anybody want to disable the "raw" behavior, just load the wmi=20
       driver.

Does it right?

Thank's
