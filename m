I rebooted into Win7. You are right, on this Dell Vostro 3550 the Fn+F2 has
only two states: turn on both BT+WiFi or turn both off. My old ASUS laptop
had 3 states and I could turn off independently BT while not WiFi. ;) 
So, rfkill application on Linux behaves in the same way as the Fn+F2 in Linux
and in Win 7.
