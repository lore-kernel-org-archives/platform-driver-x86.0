As far as I can tell, the only ACPI aspect of this driver is that it 
makes use of the ACPI EC driver? In that case I think the name's 
misleading.

We really need a better approach for this kind of thing...

And this one, but we don't have one yet so I think this is ok.

Do you have any way to identify whether the hardware has all these 
features before registering?

Is any hardware actually going to ship with this identifier, or will 
vendors change the string?
