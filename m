I think there's no technical reason impeding what you've just suggested 
in the IMR init and I'm happy to move the code in there since basically 
any platform with IMR registers could justifiably

a) Tear down everything that's unlocked
b) Place a default IMR around the .text section

No reason it the world that that policy needs to be Galileo specific - 
and it's a valid argument to say - this behaviour can simply be an IMR 
policy in the kernel and less code for the same functionality, that adds 
consistency across x86 is a good thing.

I'll zap the Galileo platform code entirely for V2 unless there's a 
counter-argument from someone.
