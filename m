The following patch series refactors the dmi check system and
returns -EPROBE_DEFER when an expected i2c adapter is not present
at probe time.

This will allow the touchpad, touchscreen, and light sensors on
Pixel to load even if the i915 DDC and PANEL buses are instantiated
after chromeos_laptop.

The deferred probing patches were sent previously, and have been cleaned up
slightly since.

Also one patch to clean up the placement of __initdata for the dmi_table.

Finally, add support for the Haswell generation Chromebook systems' 
peripherals over the new native i2c-designware-pci busses.

The last three patches depend on this patch series :
