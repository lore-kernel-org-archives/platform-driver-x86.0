Earlier question from Andy.  I had some discussion with the right people ab=
out this.

> Is it just the "call SMBIOS" GUID or are there other things?

Today - it's just the SMBIOS calling GUID.  There are plans (not yet concre=
te) for
splitting up data access and organization of that data access classes acros=
s multiple=20
 other GUID/method pairs in the future.

Ideally this could be done without needing kernel patches every time a new =
GUID
would (essentially) need to be whitelisted.

So considering future plans, I'd really like if it's possible to expose all=
 the GUID's the
GUID's the same as Windows does today.

As example is we have some diagnostic testing tools.  Having to whitelist i=
nterfaces
for them to operate would be sub-optimal.
