So if everyone here thinks we should completely switch to using the
ACPI HID "INT33A1" for attaching to the device, sure, we can do that.
Yes, for Chromeos, we can put in a work around internally that ensures
that shipping chromebooks (Kabylake etc) can work fine without that
ACPI ID. What I do not know is if that will cause any regressions
outside of Chromeos. Can you discuss with Rafael, Andy, Srinivas
internally and let me know on how they'd like to proceed on this.

The other option is to apply this patch as-is so we know that there is
no "functional change" and thus no possible regression (so the driver
continues to attach to those and only those systems that it used to,
before this patch). And then introduce the ACPI ID Change as a new
independent patch.

Let me know.
