If I understand you correctly you suggest to call either inhibit,
if provided or close, if inhibit is not provided, but not both,
that is, if both are provided then on the inhibit path only
inhibit is called. And, consequently, you suggest to call either
uninhibit or open, but not both. The rest of my mail makes this
assumption, so kindly confirm if I understand you correctly.

In my opinion this idea will not work.

The first question is should we be able to inhibit a device
which is not opened? In my opinion we should, in order to be
able to inhibit a device in anticipation without needing to
open it first.

Then what does opening (with input_open_device()) an inhibited
device mean? Should it succeed or should it fail? If it is not
the first opening then effectively it boils down to increasing
device's and handle's counters, so we can allow it to succeed.
If, however, the device is being opened for the first time,
the ->open() method wants to be called, but that somehow
contradicts the device's inhibited state. So a logical thing
to do is to either fail input_open_device() or postpone ->open()
invocation to the moment of uninhibiting - and the latter is
what the patches in this series currently do.

Failing input_open_device() because of the inhibited state is
not the right thing to do. Let me explain. Suppose that a device
is already inhibited and then a new matching handler appears
in the system. Most handlers (apm-power.c, evbug.c, input-leds.c,
mac_hid.c, sysrq.c, vt/keyboard.c and rfkill/input.c) don't create
any character devices (only evdev.c, joydev.c and mousedev.c do),
so for them it makes no sense to delay calling input_open_device()
and it is called in handler's ->connect(). If input_open_device()
now fails, we have lost the only chance for this ->connect() to
succeed.

Summarizing, IMO the uninhibit path should be calling both
->open() and ->uninhibit() (if provided), and conversely, the inhibit
path should be calling both ->inhibit() and ->close() (if provided).

What's your opinion?

Andrzej
