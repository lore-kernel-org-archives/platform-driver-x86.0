Hi Mario,

I look at the DSDT again and again but unfortunately can not find anything
may cause the bluetooth device initial failed. BTEN looks like the switch
for EC to turn on/off bluetooth, BTST records the status of BTEN and BTPS
means bluetooth present. But no idea why initial failed after BTEN=1

So I fall back to your suggestion. Have a module parameter to tell module
not to register rfkill for bluetooth.

I prepare the driver and please spend some time testing. Driver is at

http://kernel.ubuntu.com/git?p=ikepanhc/ideapad-laptop.git;a=blob;f=drivers/platform/x86/ideapad-laptop.c;h=c4cf46a363f3f72d6db5339ec326d282d7e58183;hb=26a58948693b7d25960299a8025e569e68f28937

and you may use "insmod ideapad-laptop.ko no_bt_rfkill=1" for your S12.

For more information, please see the following link:
