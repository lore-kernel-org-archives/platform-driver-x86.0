A couple of loose thoughts here.

In principle there could be a "generic default WMI driver" or similar that would
"claim" all WMI "devices" that have not been "claimed" by anyone else and would
simply expose them to user space somehow (e.g. using a chardev interface).

Then, depending on how that thing is implemented, opt-in etc should be possible
too.

Thanks,
