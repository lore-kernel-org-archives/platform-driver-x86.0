Patch is generally fine, thanks for addressing my comments. Prior to merging I
always run checkpatch.pl just in case I missed anything obvious:

$ scripts/checkpatch.pl ~/samsung/01-lid-handling.patch 
WARNING: Prefer kstrto<type> to single variable sscanf
#219: FILE: drivers/platform/x86/samsung-laptop.c:900:
+       if (!count || sscanf(buf, "%i", &value) != 1)
+               return -EINVAL;

total: 0 errors, 1 warnings, 219 lines checked

Please always run checkpatch.pl. It isn't sufficient and doesn't catch
everything, but it is a minimum bar kind of thing.

Thanks,
