Hi Lubomir,

You asked for some tips on how to incorporate the changes in a patch
series like this.

Keep in mind that each patch should create an independent small
functional change. This makes it easier to review the patch and verify
that what you said you were going to do matches what the patch does. For
example, if you separate out the style, whitespace, ordering of
declarations into an initial first patch, then all that noise is removed
when the reviewer goes to check to implementation of one of the features
below.

This is a large patch, and should most certainly be broken up into
several smaller patches. Do cleanups first, followed by functional
changes. This ordering ensure that when a "git blame" is used in the
future to understand why a given line is what it is, the first hit will
be a functional change, and not a cleanup.

Please make this a separate change, possibly more than one, depending on
how many of these there are. This will reduce the size of the subsequent
patches, making them easier to review.

Just from these comments, each of these could be a separate patch. You
can group related things together, or those that change the same line or
function for example. Order them with cleanups / non-functional-changes
first, followed by functional changes.

Andy, what was your intent for Lubomir here? From the above, this looks
like it should be several patches to me.

Thanks,
