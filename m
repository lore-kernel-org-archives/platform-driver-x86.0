Hello again,

I've found some time yesterday to give it a try and first had a look at the EC
register space. I've actually managed to find a register which reflects
the state of the hotkeys - it's register 0xE6. I could probably now just
write a driver to poll this at 5 or 10 Hz and be done with it, but that
solution seems a little hackish. The EC register space is probably still
necessary for accelerometer access (I'll try to set the X/Y/ZALM bits to
1 later and see what happens), but I think for hotkeys, an event-based
solution would be better.

AFAICT it's never accessed anywhere else, right? So it's going to sit
there at 0x00 and the Notify (\_SB.WMI2, 0x80) code will never be
called.

I still have a bit of confusion going on with respect to the difference
between WMI notifications and EC notifications. The Notify() call above
would trigger the WMI notification, but in what way would the kernel be
notified about something like the following:

	Method (_Q8F, 0, NotSerialized)
	{
		Store ("_Q8F : Hot Key Event", Debug)
		Store (0x8F, P80H)
		DSGO ()
		DSSV ()
		Store ("_Q8F : Hot Key Event Finished", Debug)
	}

IIRC all _Qxx methods are also some kind of notification system, right?

Thanks, Yours, Florian
