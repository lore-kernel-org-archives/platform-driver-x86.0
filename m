It really can't do anything. Have you ever seen userspace handling
errors from close()? And what can be done? A program is terminating, but
the kernel says "no, you closing input device failed, you have to
continue running indefinitely..."

I will note here, that inhibit is closer to suspend() than to close(),
and we do report errors for suspend(). Therefore we could conceivably
try to handle errors if driver really wants to be fancy. But I think
majority of cases will be quite happy with using close() and simply
logging errors, as Hans said.

That said, I think the way we should handle inhibit/uninhibit, is that
if we have the callback defined, then we call it, and only call open and
close if uninhibit or inhibit are _not_ defined.

No, please, no flag days and no changing close() to return error, it
makes no sense for close().

Well, we have the dedicated callbacks in Chrome OS, so when I did the
patch I could even handle Ctrl-C, so why not? But it indeed can easily
be dropped in favor of straight mutex_lock().

Thanks.
