Just checked your DSDT, didn't see _BCM implementation on this machines=
,
and also didn't see useful _Q event function.

Could you please help to enable acpi debug log?
	acpi.debug_level=3D0x2 acpi.debug_layer=3D0xFFFFFFFF

Please attached dmesg and messages log that cover system boot and
pressed brightness key a couple of times.

And,=20
Please also monitor does there have any value of gpe was increased when
you press brightness keys:

watch -n 1 cat /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe[012][0123456789ABCDEF]

Please tell me which gpe's value increased if you found.


Thanks a lot!
Joey Lee
