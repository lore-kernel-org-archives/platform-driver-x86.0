The new series is a 3-patch patchset that obsoletes this
patch. It is in the testing stage and will be pushed to
the mailing lists and maintainers in a few days.

No, because the ACPI battery driver is a extension to the generic
power supply driver, that does not understand the battery wear control.
Also, Rafael specifically noted NOT to include any thinkpad_acpi-specific
behavior to the generic drivers.

That behavior you are describing can be implemented in the userspace.

Thanks for the time!
