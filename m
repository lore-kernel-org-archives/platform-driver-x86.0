Thank you for taking the time to test this series, it is appreciated.  I
would not expect the switching method (GUI/hotkey) to matter here, as
long as we can compare behavior of two kernel versions by consistently
using one of them.

Just to be sure, I assume you meant 7280?

I am confused.  This patch series should apply cleanly to 4.9 and its
surroundings.  Between 4.8 and 4.9, commit 4875a5f72180 ("ALSA: hda -
Fix a failure of micmute led when having multi adcs") happened.   This
makes it impossible to apply this patch series cleanly on top of 4.8
without reducing context to one line.

Moreover, I applied this patch series (with reduced context) to 4.8 and
successfully compiled the kernel.  Could you shed some light on where
exactly did your build crash?

Any chance of a git bisect?

This is even more confusing.  Between 4.9, which you claim works fine,
and 4.10-rc8, which you claim does not work, I can see no changes to
either drivers/leds/dell-led.c or sound/pci/hda/dell_wmi_helper.c.
Kernel configuration issue?

No surprises here if it really does not work with 4.10-rc8.
