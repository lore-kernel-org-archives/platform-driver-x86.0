From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

The intel-hid driver is missing a PM ->thaw callback allowing the
device to go back to the operational state after creating a
hibernation image or when there is an image restoration error during
resume.

The lack of the ->thaw callback basically means that all events
signaled by the device are discarded after a hibernation image has
been created which may be problematic, for example, if the image
cannot be saved (eg. due to an I/O issue with storage).
