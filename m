There's a ton of documentation out there about what kinds of protections
SGX provides.  I don't think this is an appropriate place to have an
exhaustive discussion about it.  But, there's extensive discussion of it
on Intel's security site:

https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/

There's documentation on how L1TF affects SGX here:

https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/software-guidance/l1-terminal-fault

Or Spectre v2 here:

https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/software-guidance/bounds-check-bypass

The CVEs list this in pretty exhaustive detail.  The L1TF/SGX one, for
example:

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3615

Lists a bunch of processor models.
