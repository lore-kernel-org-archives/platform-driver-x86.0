My opinion is that we'd better figure out another representative name, as
it actually affects other things...

...though I won't insist if you still prefer kbd_backlight, as long as
others are not opposed to it.

Got it. We can figure out a way to coordinate LampArray autonomous mode
with it in the future.

In this case you don't need the pre-allocated buffer, too. Let's allocate
a tiny buffer on stack.

Great :-)
