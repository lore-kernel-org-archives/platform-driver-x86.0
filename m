Well, the pattern looks like I/O - mmapped I/O.
        Store (Arg1, \_SB.INF0)
        Store (Arg0, \_SB.BCMD)
        Store (Zero, \_SB.SMIC)
        Store (\_SB.INF0, Local0)

Note that INF0 is written before and read after writing SMIC. Hence,
for this to be useful, something must have happened inbetween, i.e.
I/O :)

What exactly do you mean with "there are some sync failed"? I don't see
anything like that in the logs.

Hmmm, I don't know if I got you right. I didn't find any new drivers to
test, so I tried to add some more debug code myself. Hope this helps.
I added some code to show_ideapad_cam() to be able to asynchronously
trigger reading of BTST, BTEN, and BTPS. As before: the patch attached
is not for inclusion but to show what I did. I'm usually not a kernel
hacker, so please take a serious look at what I did before trusting the
results :)

I attached a full protocol of actions I performed including kernel
dmesges. Typed commands are prepended by #, manual actions and comments
are enclosed in <>, kernel messages are timestamped, the rest is output
of the commands.
Basically I did the following:
0. I started with a fresh powered up system, all RF devices powered on.
1. I hw-switched RF off and back on, which went okay.
2. I sw-switched BT off and back on, which resulted in erroneous
initialization.
3. I again sw-switched BT off and back on, which resulted in BT being
completely gone.
4. I hw-switched RF off and back on, which brought BT back and
operational.

Hmmm, I don't understand your reasoning here.
I said the device disappears and re-appears when using the hw rf switch,
this doesn't look like it would turn off PHY only.
