If this testing is necessary for this sysfs callback, it is needed for all of them. Looking at the code more closely, I think this is out of scope for this patch. The entire file assumes a valid toshiba_acpi_dev. If this is a problem, it needs a separate patch to address it. So, let's drop this change, update the commit log to match the new sysfs filenames, and this should be ready to go.
