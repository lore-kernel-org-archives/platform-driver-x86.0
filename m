That's true. The problem is that if we forbid such values, the writes
will need to be done in a specific order. Let's say I have a system
with
	start=0		stop=50
and I want to change it to
	start=60	stop=80

If we return -EINVAL on a case stop < start, the only way to do this
is setting stop first and then start, because if we wrote start first,
then we would have: start > stop (because 60 > 50). But the error
message when doing it the wrong way around will not be very helpful
and I think it is confusing.

We might be able to work around this by simple setting stop = start
if a new write causes the stop threshold to be below the start
threshold. But this also seems ugly.

Writing the value 0 effectively means setting the stop threshold to 100%.
The EC itself does not accept the value 100. I don't know why they choose
to implement it this way. So the code should not accept 0 as an input
value and replace an input of 100 with 0.

The exact value returned by the ACPI call is 0x80000000, that is, 
a signed 0 integer with sign bit set to 1. A set sign bit indicates
an error.

It does not seem to do this here.
