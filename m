Hi Matthew,
You didn't include "asus-laptop: fix gps rfkill", which fix a NULL
dereference when there is a GPS device.
I think this patch should really be merged (also sent it to
stable@kernel.org, for previous version).
Maybe we should open a patchwork for platform-x86 ml to tack patchs ?
There was one on linux-acpi,
and it was really helpful.
Thanks,
