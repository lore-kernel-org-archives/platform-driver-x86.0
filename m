It is working fine. I do not see any problem.

Yes, but in this case half of device is ACPI based and other half i2c=20
based. This is problem of ACPI and Dell design.

Yes. I understand that clean solution is to have one driver which=20
provides everything.

But because half of data are ACPI and half i2c, you still needs to=20
create two drivers (one ACPI and one i2c). You can put both drivers into=20
one .ko module, but still these will be two drivers due to how ACPI and=20
i2c linux abstractions are different.

With Micha=C5=82 we already discussed about it, see emails. Basically you c=
an=20
enable/disable kernel modules at compile time or blacklist at runtime=20
(or even chose what will be compiled into vmlinux and what as external=20
=2Eko module). Some distributions blacklist i2c-i801.ko module... And=20
there can be also problem with initialization of i2c-i801 driver (fix is=20
in commit a7ae81952cda, but does not have to work at every time!). So=20
that move on whitelisted machines can potentially cause disappearance of=20
/dev/freefall and users will not have hdd protection which is currently=20
working.
