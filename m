Hi! Thank you finally for response!

Ok, I will then make list of supported ACPI devices and put them into
two places with comment about syncing.

Yes. And in same way instantiating ACPI driver dell-smo8800 from
i2c-i801 is not practical too.

This is not a problem. lis3lv02d provides two things:

1) 3 axes accelerometer
2) optional interrupt and signal it to userspace via misc device

dell-smo8800 does not call any parts of lis2lv02d module. It just
provides for userspace same misc device API as lis3lv02d.

As lis3lv02d has misc device optional, registered i2c device from
i2c-i801 does not enable it.

So technically it is one device, but their functionality divided into
two modules. One which reports accelerometer axes and one which signals
disk fall interrupt. These two modules and functionalities does not have
to interact, so it is safe to have them separated.
