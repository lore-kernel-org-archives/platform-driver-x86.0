I don't know if that works though. Does it make more sense? I'm not
sure. Why bother with "persistent" then anyway? I think the logic as we
had it was meant to make things follow the persistent state you had
before you shut down and that was saved in the BIOS or whatever.

No I mean ... it seems that the BIOS reports both a hotkey and an rfkil=
l
event. Could those be clashing?

It seems that what happens is roughly this:
 1) at boot, all BT is set to soft-killed due to the way the BIOS
    started up
 2) when you press the button, it's a toggle, so rfkill-input toggles
    all BT rfkill instances (acer and hci0)
 3) now acer _also_ reports, via rfkill_set_sw_state(), that the acer B=
T
    rfkill instance is not soft-blocked

Then again, even that should work fine? Clearly I don't understand the
issue yet.

Well, I don't think we should require a config to work "out of the box"=
,
so I'm not sure that makes sense.

Yeah but when urfkill starts up, it could just force the status it
thinks things have. Since it can simply override the current status
there doesn't seem to be a need for disabling the logic first.

Still though I don't understand how we arrive at the issue at all.

Old=C5=99ich, can you run "rfkill event" while you press the button wit=
h a
stock kernel that shows the problem and no patches?
