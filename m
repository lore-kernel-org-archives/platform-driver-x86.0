That could be done, but it would not change the fact that the
/sys/class/firmware is ABI and you may not break it.


And it doesn't change the fact that the ramdisk would have to be over
100mb to facilitate this.

This is still a problem that lacks a solution.

Remember that putting the firmware in the ramdisk would cost about
10000x (yes, ten thousand times) more ram.

Combined with a way of synchronizing this with the availability of the
firmware, this would be a nice thing!
