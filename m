Did you mean you direct set CONFIG_RFKILL_INPUT=3DN in kernel and rebui=
ld
kernel? or you used userland app like urfkill to send out ioctl to
disable rfkill-input?

Thank's for your test result.
Want to double confirm with you...
The above result is base on CONFIG_RFKILL_INPUT=3DN ?

I just simply check the rfkill stuff,
I found when CONFIG_RFKILL_INPUT set to enable and there have any drive=
r
call rfkill_init_sw_state before register rfkill object, then rfkill
will sync this state to all killswitch that have the same type and also
will set the same initial state to new killswitch have the same type.

Looks like rfkill will sync the state for the same type killswitch if
used rfkill_init_sw_state, I will do more detail debug and trace for
rfkill stuff, then find out solution.


Thank's a lot!
Joey Lee
