What I'm saying is: I don't really care what's the default behavior is,
but if the EC provide a somewhat reliable way to make the key work
without any userspace daemon involved, I think we should allow
the user to use this mode (even if it's with an obscure module
parameter or sysfs file).

But .. maybe if someone want this default "raw" behavior,
he should just not load this module.
