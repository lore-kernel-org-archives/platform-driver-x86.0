I took those values from a Windows utility provided by Dell. I tried
to find a reason for that specific list to exist, but I couldn't. The
reason why it's there is that the BIOS of my laptop accepts any timeout,
but it silently sets the timeout to 0 (i.e. illumination never off)
if a value not in that list is given. So, given the wide range of
of possible input values, we added that quirk. This is something my
laptop does, Pali's behaves differently and such a list is not needed.
