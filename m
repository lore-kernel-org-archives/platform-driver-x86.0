In case it is useful to know, I installed Debian stretch following this:
https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Asus/E200HA

I built my kernel using a relatively minimal kernel config,
let me know if you want it.  I could also post the
two patches which port the mfd and opregion drivers, but
they are straight forward copies of intel_soc_pmic_crc.c
and intel_pmic_crc.c from 4.10.0-rc6+ with code copy&pasted
from the ProductionKernelQuilts patches and s/crc/dc_ti/ etc.,
except I scamped the thermal handler to skip the ADC driver port for now.


Maybe I should've used intel_pmic_xpower.c instead of
intel_pmic_crc.c, since as I write this I see there
is a no-op intel_xpower_pmic_gpio_handler() registered.
This is the trick that fixes this:
        \_SB.PCI0.I2C7.PMI2.AVBG Integer      ffff8be7b74d9be0 01 = 0000000000000001

But now it generates ACPI errors about thermal zone
and "acpi -V" usually hangs it up.

(I knew my thermal opregion code was preliminary but I didn't expect it to error.)


Thanks,
