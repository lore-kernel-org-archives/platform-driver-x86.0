Interesting, that contradicts the read we had gotten on FLC.

The only specific CPU's that we know of that are acknowledged to have
FLC are the XEON E series in support of the PCE/ECDSA attestation for
data-center use of SGX.

I'm assuming this is a really new system?  If so that matches our
experience with respect to the fact that SGX2/EDMM capable systems
slipped out quietly in early generation NUC SOC's.

Your sentinments are correct with respect to getting solid guidance on
hardware, it is a significant issue, particularly with respect to
SGX.

I will reply to the LE and driver capability issues in my response to
your earlier e-mail so the thread does not diverge.

Jarkko, when this driver lands it will set the SGX ABI in stone for
Linux.  It would be very, very helpful to the development community if
there was some official guidance from Intel on whether or not FLC will
be a universal feature on all hardware and the date that is going to
happen or has happened.

If this turns out to be an OEM selectable issue via firmware
customizations, things will be even more problematic.

As things stand now, the proposed mainline SGX driver is going to be
useless for a lot of hardware that is out in the field.  Linux has
always had the reputation for supporting legacy hardware so this
directly contravenes that principal and needlessly so.
