Generally the intention behind introducing userspace LED class driver
was to have a means for intercepting kernel LED events. I agree that
having LED class device generating trigger events is awkward. It was
just the first thing that came to my mind seeing the idea of polling,
and having the fresh memory of userspace LED driver.

I am inclined to accept your patch, but it will need thorough testing
to check if there will be no unpleasant side effects when one or more
processes will be polling the brightness sysfs file and in the
meantime other process(es) will write to it.

Also notifying only about brightness change events not caused by
writing brightness file is counter intuitive if we are polling
brightness file. What about brightness changes caused by using
led_set_brightness() API, without mediation of brightness file?

If we want to notify only brightness changes originating from
hardware, maybe it would be a good idea to add a dedicated
sysfs file? It could appear only if relevant option in the
kernel config was turned on.
