What I'm getting from a quick scan of the documents is that both SCI and HCI are
enabled using the same read from B2, but SCI appears to be a superset of HCI (or
perhaps better said we are now using SCI+HCI and not just HCI.

This suggests to me that this driver has grown to include some SCI-specific
commands/features and now it's time to rename the interface to reflect this more
accurately.

Is that more or less the situation?

If this is more or less the lay of things, then please combine the function
definition change and callsite update patch (note that things should always
build at each patch to enable bisection, etc.), update the comments as you noted
below, and submit a V2.

It's a stretch for 3.18 as I'd prefer to have things in linux-next for two weeks
prior to submitting to Linus. Let's see how it goes.
