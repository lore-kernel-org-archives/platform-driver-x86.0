Subject: Re: hp-wmi: WHCM AE_AML_OPERAND_TYPE and fan init -22 on HP
OmniBook 5 16-ag1xxx (board 8DF4)

Hi Krishna,

Thanks a lot for digging into the ACPI code, the explanation makes
everything fit: the missing GMCF call for HPWMI_GM, Local2 being left
as an Integer, and the -22 coming from that.

I also tried your suggestion about the platform profile. With
HPWMI_READ/WRITE the errors should not appear:

  Before: dmesg | grep -c WHCM  ->  3 (the three boot-time errors)
  cat /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile  ->  quiet
  After:  dmesg | grep -c WHCM  ->  3 (no new errors)

On the fan: thanks for confirming that acpi_fan reads the EC value
correctly. Together with hearing the fan on Mint and on CachyOS at
idle, that makes me fairly comfortable that the 0 RPM readings are the
fan really being off.

Your plan to query the fan count and hide pwm1_enable and
fan{1,2}_input when it fails sounds good to me. I am happy to test it
on 8DF4 whenever you have a patch, and I can rebase it onto a stable
kernel tree on my side if that is easier for you.

I also tried 7.2.10-1-cachyos: dmesg and the hp-wmi hwmon folder are
identical to 7.2.9 (three WHCM errors, then the -22 message, and
pwm1_enable still present).

Thanks again for the time you spent on this.

Best regards,
Lorenzo
