Yes, for the commands we care about, we only pay attention to the first
4 bytes, but it really is 20 bytes long from what I can tell.

Ah, good point.  The code was originally a port from some example code
provided by Samsung, this must have remained from that example, I'll go
fix it up.

Hm, in looking at the code, I think I did this just to make it "only
lock and unlock at one place in the function".  I'll rework it to be a
bit more "sane".

Nothing is guaranteed from this interface from what I can tell. :)

I really don't know, in my tests, I only had one failure, and that ended
up being my fault for sending the wrong command.

Will do.

Yeah, I was thinking I should just accept all Samsung laptops now that
we can properly detect the type of SABI interface that the machine has.
That would reduce this table, and make users happy that they don't have
to keep adding new devices to it.  I'll make that change as well.

It would, but at this point, we don't have a valid 'struct device' to
hang it off of.  I could create the platform device earlier in the
function, which would allow us to show errors a bit "prettier" if you
think that would be a good idea.

I know of no way to detect this.  The driver assumes that we always have
wifi.  I actually haven't seen a Samsung laptop without it, have you?
