Thanks for the DSDT and the following information.

I am not an expert on AML but after looking to the DSDT, I think I will
focus on what XCMD do.

I notice there are some interesting method/variable (Ex: BTEN/BTST..)
about bluetooth, but not have a good story about what's going on.

I think the only problem we have now is bluetooth sometimes not coming
back when rebooting after turn off bluetooth via sw rfkill. Try to find
out if there is anything need to be done before turn it on.
