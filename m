Why so? The new feature would be made optional so existing users
wouldn't be affected, unless they enabled it in the kernel
config.

It would entail changes in all triggers, I'd like to avoid for the
reasons I provided in one of the previous messages.

I've just looked one more time at POLLPRI description in poll(2)
documentation:

"There is urgent data to read (e.g., out-of-band data on TCP socket;
pseudoterminal master in packet mode has seen state change in slave)."

I don't think that brightness changes originating from triggers fall
into this category, whereas the ones originating from hardware do.

In view of the above we could report hw brightness changes with POLLPRI
on brightness file, but unfortunately we can't because it is impossible
to guarantee that readout of brightness file will return the brightness
the POLLPRI was meant to notify about.

That's why a separate read only file seems to be the only proper
solution. Moreover, the file should return the brightness from the time
of last POLLPRI.
