The privacy concerns valid, but they're not insurmountable. You could
make userspace listen to the LED status and react as if the mute button
was pressed, making sure the two can never really go out of sync (just
an example off the top of my head).

Even if you don't do that, IMO it makes sense to expose the LEDs to
userspace. We're effectively talking about how the LEDs should behave as
an extension of the UI, and freezing the policy that governs that UI in
userspace is pretty inflexible.
