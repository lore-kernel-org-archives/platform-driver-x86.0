I agree. If there's an alternative I couldn't find it, and not for a
lack of trying.

I checked all the Toshiba DSDTs I have, and every machine with NTFY is a
TOS1900 machine, but only a subset of the TOS1900 machines have NTFY. So
I think we need to still limit it to only machines with NTFY. I can add
an additional check for TOS1900 if that's what you want.
