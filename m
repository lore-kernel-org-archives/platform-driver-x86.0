Hehe, sometime the platform interface doesn't work and the raw does.
That's the case on various samsung-laptop since we have absolutely no
documentation about SABI and no known way to probe if the
implementation is working or not. But anyway, for samsung-laptop it's
disabled by default in favor of acpi_video (which is also broken most
of the time on samsung laptops).
