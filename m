Hi Ciro,

Thanks for working on this.

IMHO, the support for 048d:c197 is the only thing you should include in
the series.

IOW, do not add a device-specific driver when it could be handled by a
generic one, i.e., the ongoing hid-lamparray series. While you can
rewrite your series to make it work with hid-lamparray, it would be much
easier to review and accept your series when it has no dependence on a
ongoing work.

Let's take it step by step, and submit a driver for 048d:c197 first. As
far as I understood, the driver should be able to handle "hardware
brightness (0..9, stored), the controller's own effects (stored
profiles)," and "Fn+Up/Down/Space" by its own. (Please correct me if I
misunderstood your words.)

I am also working on a independent hid-lamparray implementation that is
far more generic than=C2=A0Aaron and Werner's series. It still needs some
polishing and depends on another series of mime [1]. I've mentioned some
details of my implementation there.

I am not going to review PATCH 2, unless your next revision no longer
adds a device-specific driver for 048d:c193.

But I did have a glance at PATCH 2, things could easily go wrong when you
invent your own mechanism to bind things. And it's not scalable anyway.

Please use the component framework (not in your next revision, it should
only add support for 048d:c197).
