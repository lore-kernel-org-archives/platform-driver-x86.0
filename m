Why is this still an RFC?

> Some laptops can tune their keyboard backlight according to ambient
> light sensors (auto mode). This capability is essentially a hardware
> control trigger. Meanwhile, such laptops also offer a shrotcut for
> cycling through brightness levels and auto mode. For example, on
> ThinkBook, pressing Fn+Space ("shortcut") cycles keyboard backlight
> levels in the following sequence:
> 
>   1 => 2 => 0 => auto => 1 ...
> 
> Recent ThinkPad models should have similar sequence too.
> 
> However, there are some issues preventing us from using a private
> hardware control trigger:
> 
> 1. We want a mechanism to tell userspace which trigger is the hardware
>    control one, so that userspace can determine if auto mode is on/off,
>    as well as turing it on/off programmatically without obtaining the
>    trigger's name via other channels
> 2. Writing brightness has the side effect of disabling hardware control,
>    but the hardware control trigger remains active, resulting in the
>    software and hardware being out of sync. Most LED drivers that
>    supports hardware control also suffer from the same issue
> 3. Turing on/off auto mode via the shortcut cannot activate/deactivate
>    the corresponding hardware control trigger, making the software state
>    out of sync
> 4. Even with #3 solved, deactivating the hardware control trigger has
>    the side effect of emitting LED_OFF, breaking the shortcut cycle,
>    especially "auto => 1"
> 
> This RFC series tries to demonstrate a path on solving these issues:
> 
> - Introduce an attribute "trigger_may_offload", so that userspace can
>   determine:
>   - if the LED device supports hardware control (supported => visible)
>   - which trigger is the hardware control trigger selected by the LED
>     device
>   - if the trigger is selected ("<foo_trigger>")
>   - if the trigger is offloaded ("[foo_trigger]")
>     - A callback offloaded() is added so that LED triggers can report
>       their hardware control state
> - Remove hardware control trigger when writing brightness
> - Add led_trigger_notify_hw_control_changed() interface, so that LED
>   drivers can notify the LED core about hardware-initiated hardware
>   control transitions. The LED core will then determine if the
>   transition is allowed and switching between "none" (i.e., no trigger)
>   and the device's private trigger accordingly
>   - This capability is restricted to the device's private trigger. If
>     the current trigger is neither the private trigger nor "none", no
>     transition will be made
>   - This interface is gated behind Kconfig LEDS_TRIGGERS_HW_CHANGED and
>     LED device flag LED_TRIG_HW_CHANGED
> - Tune the logic of trigger deactivation so that it won't emit LED_OFF
>   when the deactivation is triggered by hardware
> 
> The last three patches are included in the RFC series to demonstrate how
> to these interfaces are supposed to be utilized, so that ideapad-laptop
> can expose the auto mode of ThinkBook's keyboard backlight. They can be
> submitted separately once the dust settles, if preferred.
> 
> [ Summary of other approaches ]
> 
> < custom attribute >
> 
> Pros:
> - simplicity, KISS
> - no need to touch the LED core
> - extensible as long as it has a sensor-neutral name
>   - a sensor-related name could potentially lead to a mess if a future
>     device implements auto mode based on multiple different sensors
> 
> Cons:
> - must have zero influence on brightness_set[_blocking] callbacks
>   in order not to break triggers
>   - potential interference with triggers and the brightness attribute,
>     can't solve #2
> - weird semantic (an attribute other than "brightness" and "trigger"
>   changes the brightness)
> 
> < private hardware control trigger (this series) >
> 
> Pros:
> - mutually exclusive with other triggers and the brightness attribute
>   (hence less chaos)
> - semantic correctness
> - acts as an aggregate switch to turn on/off auto mode even a future
>   device implements auto mode based on multiple different sensors
>   - extensibility (through trigger attributes)
> 
> Cons:
> - complexity
