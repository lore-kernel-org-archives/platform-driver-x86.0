BMOF provides mapping from human class and method names to WMI GUID. WDG
then provides mapping from WMI GUID to ACPI function names.

Therefore if you upper layer in MOF world say that it want to call
method M of class C and you want to know which ACPI function is called,
you need to parse both BMOF and WDG to get mapping from MOF to ACPI.
Same for WMI events.

When you want to write a new WMI kernel driver you definitely need to
see parsed WDG buffer.

When you take ACPI dump and then decompile it (via iasl -d) as written
in #1 you can then find particular WDG and BMOF buffers in that
decompiled ASL file. But parsing such source file correctly is not easy
and I do not know automated tool for it. Also #1 say to look at file and
find some pattern...
