Please consider this patch to thinkapd_acpi, it loads the module
on V-series systems that do not report with "Lenovo" or "ThinkPad"
prefix to DMI_PRODUCT_VERSION query, but only returns model name.


=========================================================================
Test on V490u
=============

== Before the patch ==
sudo modprobe thinkpad_acpi 
FATAL: Error inserting thinkpad_acpi (/lib/modules/3.2.0-27-generic/kernel/drivers/platform/x86/thinkpad_acpi.ko): No such device

=========================================================================
Test on B485
=============
This patch was also test in a B485 where the thinkpad_acpi module does not 
have any issues loading. But, I tested it to make sure this patch does not 
break on already functioning models of Lenovo products.
