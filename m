That probably is not the right choice, though.

ACPI "devices" are counterparts of DT device nodes and having other things
exported under them would be quite confusing.  In fact, you can argue that
the whole /sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/ directory should be located under
/sys/firmware/acpi, but it turns out to be difficult to move it there
for various reasons.

Personally, I'd go for the last one.

Thanks,
