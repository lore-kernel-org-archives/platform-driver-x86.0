If you're not adding ACPI support to an existing platform driver, you 
shouldn't be adding entries to acpi_platform.c. I'm not actually happy 
that I merged the ideapad-laptop patch that did the same thing - I'm 
inclined to revert it, because this really is an ugly way to do things.

Rafael, why did we convert the AC driver this way? It means we have to 
keep track of ACPI IDs in multiple places, which is worth it when it 
avoids having to write a pile of new code (such as the sdhci case) but 
doesn't seem to provide benefits otherwise.
