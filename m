Yes, that is correct. If a driver wants really fine-grained control, it
will provide inhibit (or both inhibit and close), otherwise it will rely
on close in place of inhibit.

I agree.

It should succeed.

So what you are trying to say is that you see inhibit as something that
is done in addition to what happens in close. But what exactly do you
want to do in inhibit, in addition to what close is doing?

In my view, if we want to have a dedicated inhibit callback, then it
will do everything that close does, they both are aware of each other
and can sort out the state transitions between them. For drivers that do
not have dedicated inhibit/uninhibit, we can use open and close
handlers, and have input core sort out when each should be called. That
means that we should not call dev->open() in input_open_device() when
device is inhibited (and same for dev->close() in input_close_device).
And when uninhibiting, we should not call dev->open() when there are no
users for the device, and no dev->close() when inhibiting with no users.

Do you see any problems with this approach?

Thanks.
