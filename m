I think that it should be consistent, if there is already some code
for pegatron tablet in asus-laptop, then why a new platform device
only for the accelerometer ?

On the other side, having to load "asus-laptop" on a pegatron tablet
(or on a lenovo laptop) isn't very intuitive.

The real name of this module should be atk010x_acpi, but it's not
really better, and it's probably too late for that.

Andy, what is shared with asus-laptop exactly ? What sysfs files are
working and enabled ?
Are backlight and led classes working ?

Thanks,
