And then it needs to change them; if anything goes wrong error recovery
is practically impossible since the trigger information is lost
forever.

It's not my position to decide which combinations some system
integrator or userspace developer might find useful.

Even when we add parameters to a trigger (I don't see a generic way to
do that, but please do enlighten me), you're now ignoring the issue of
the userspace controlled GSM modem...

I'd say it's well-defined for any given set of system software, so if
e.g. NetworkManager decides to define it one way, and connman another
way, there's a definition but the kernel need not interfere with it.

I pretty much have to read it that way, since the LED API is in no way
impacted by these changes. Here's a new trigger, with some magic inner
working. No impact on the LED API.
