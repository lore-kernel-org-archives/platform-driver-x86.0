I don't have any use-cases to test using normal interrupts, so I
will leave adding support for that to the first patch adding support
for a device which needs that, such as the HID3515 you mention.

I do agree that it is good to prepare for adding this later, so
I'm going to post a v6 doing s/irq_idx/gpio_irq_idx/
