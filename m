Traced the your dsdt from 8460p.

Let's see "set ALS" first, when set ALS enable, BIOS didn't _eat_ any
input value for brightness level:


    Method (WHCM, 2, NotSerialized)
    {
        CreateDWordField (Arg1, 0x00, SNIN)     /* signature */
        CreateDWordField (Arg1, 0x04, COMD)     /* command =3D write ? =
0x2 : 0x1 */
        CreateDWordField (Arg1, 0x08, CMTP)     /* commandtype */
        CreateDWordField (Arg1, 0x0C, DASI)
        Store ("HandleWMICommand Enter", Debug)
=2E..
    If (LEqual (COMD, 0x02))            /* command write */
    {
        Store ("write BIOS command", Debug)
=2E...
        If (LEqual (CMTP, 0x03))        /* write HPWMI_ALS_QUERY 0x3 */
        {
            Store (^WSAL (DDWD), Local2)  /* call ^WSAL and feed DDWD *=
/
            Store (0x00, RTCD)
        }


            Method (WSAL, 1, NotSerialized)     /* write HPWMI_ALS_QUER=
Y 0x3 */
            {
                If (LEqual (PRDT, 0x03))=20
                {
                    Return (Package (0x02)
                    {
                        0x04,
                        0x00
                    })
                }

                \_SB.SSMI (0xEA75, 0x02, 0x03, 0x574D4953, 0x00)   /* e=
mit SMI, BIOS code take job but didn't feed Arg0 to BIOS */
                Return (WFDA ())
            }

Everything handle by BIOS function after emit SMI event, and it didn't
give BIOS any input value of brightness.
So, didn't find any way to change brightness through set ALS.


Then, I found another interesting command for 'write brightness', hp-wm=
i
doesn't have implementation for this command:=20

        If (LEqual (CMTP, 0x06))        /* set brightness? */
        {
            Store ("write Brightness", Debug)
            Store (^SBBC (DDWD), Local2)	/* call DDWD */
            Store (Local2, Debug)
            Store (0x00, RTCD)
        }

            Method (SBBC, 1, NotSerialized)     /* write brighenss? did=
n't do anything? */
            {
                Return (Package (0x02)		/* just only return a package *=
/
                {
                    0x04,
                    0x00
                })
            }


Unfortunately, the 0x06 command also doesn't do anything for change
brightness on your machine.

Sorry! Didn't find any way can change brightness on your machine unless
we have drm driver support ATI acpi events.


Thanks a lot!
