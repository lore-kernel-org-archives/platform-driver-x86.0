I cannot prove it... lis3lv02d i2c driver itself uses this IRQ logic
(missing = no freefall) and there could be already hardware/boards which
register lis3lv02d i2c device without IRQ number. And definitions could
be also in device tree and so outside of kernel sources...

So there can be potentially break. But at least not case of Dell.

Yes.

Now I understood that Dmitri means. For this Dell platforms it is OK,
but we have a problem for device tree platforms. Normally in device tree
if device does not support something you just do not specify it. But
with this approach you need to explicitly specify IRQ to -1 in device
tree. And I think this is really not a clean solution.
