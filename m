e9f850ba66cd works, thank you. With it applied I get 
/sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm and the -ENXIO message is gone:

   rtc_cmos PNP0B00:00: RTC can wake from S4
   rtc_cmos PNP0B00:00: registered as rtc0
   rtc_cmos PNP0B00:00: alarms up to one month, y3k, 114 bytes nvram
   8: ... IO-APIC 8-edge rtc0

With amd_iommu=off and all 24 CPUs I now get fully unattended timed cycles:

   pm_wakeup_irq:        9
   Last S0i3 Status:     Success
   Time (in us) to S0i3: 430540
   Residency Time:       13282379
   last_hw_sleep:        13282379
   ff_rt_clk:            incremented on each cycle

One small platform note in case it is useful to you: IRQ 8 never fires 
on this machine while the system is running. If I arm an alarm and poll, 
the alarm counts down and expires exactly on schedule but the IRQ 8 
counter stays at zero:

   t=0   arming +8       irq8=0
   t=1-7 wakealarm=1790194169   irq8=0
   t=8   wakealarm=''           irq8=0
   t=15  wakealarm=''           irq8=0

Identical with the IOMMU on and off, so it is not an interrupt remapping 
effect. The wake itself comes through the ACPI fixed-feature RTC event 
rather than IRQ 8, which is why it works anyway: ff_rt_clk increments 
and pm_wakeup_irq reports 9. IRQ 8 does register a single count at 
resume time.

Now the part that matters. With the IOMMU enabled and all 24 CPUs, the 
same timed suspend does not wake. Recorded before the cycle:

   === 2026-09-23T22:15:02 BEFORE
   cmdline:     (no iommu parameters)
   cpus online: 0-23
   iommu:       ivhd0
   ff_rt_clk:   0
   S0ix Entry Time: 0
   S0ix Exit Time: 0
   Residency Time: 0
   suspending with +30s alarm

Nothing was written after that. The machine never resumed and needed a 
forced power off.

So with the IOMMU enabled, every independent wake mechanism on this 
machine has now been tried and none of them work:

   lid switch (PNP0C0D)                          no wake
   internal keyboard (i8042, via AMD GPIO)       no wake
   power button (ACPI fixed feature)             no wake
   USB mouse, wakeup armed on device and hub     no wake
   ACPI fixed-feature RTC alarm                  no wake

The last one seems the most pointed to me. The RTC alarm wakes the 
machine through the ACPI SCI on IRQ 9, and that is exactly the path that 
works when amd_iommu=off - pm_wakeup_irq reports 9 on every successful 
cycle. With the IOMMU enabled the same mechanism produces nothing at 
all, and ff_rt_clk stays at 0 across the attempt.

Still to come: the 7.3-rc4 test, and a manual walk through BIOS setup 
looking for storage link power or D3 controls that think-lmi does not 
export.
