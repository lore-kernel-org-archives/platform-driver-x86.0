So problem which I spotted is not only theoretical, but already affects
users... Pity that I have not looked at that patch which introduced that
problem deeply earlier :-(

So there is race condition between initializing dell-laptop driver and
calling exported function from this driver. But does not we still have
same problem at layer between dell-laptop.ko dell-sbios.ko and
dell-smbios-*.ko?

To make dell_micmute_led_set() work properly we need to ensure that
either WMI or SMM driver is already loaded and initialized.

It should go in next round of merging into linus tree and after that
with proper commit message tags it should included in next stable
versions.
