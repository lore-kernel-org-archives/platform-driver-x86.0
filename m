The BIOS interface is reliable on business client (Latitude and Vostro) hardware.

The outliers of Inspiron and XPS don't seem to follow the interface as explicitly.  It is not broken on Windows.  I don't have an understanding why it's not, but conjecture that it's a different interface being used on these that I don't have information on yet.

You would be better to only match on Latitude and Vostro and anything else that people want to opt in via a paramater than to remove the interface entirely IMO.
