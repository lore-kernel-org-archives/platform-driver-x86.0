Is it only that hotkey that doesn't work, or do the others fail to work
as well?

If it's only that key that doesn't work, I'd suggest using input-events
to determine exactly which device the other hotkey events are coming
from (it might be more than one) and to verify there really isn't any
event coming out for that key. If there's no event at all for the key,
check dmesg and see if any messages are printed there when you press the
touchpad key.
