Hi,

You are perfectly right, the documentation is wrong and I'm sorry for
that. als_setting should allow you to define when the keyboard
backlight has to be turned on or off depending on the value reported
by the ambient light sensor.

Please note that not everything that is in libsmbios [1] is implemented
in the kernel driver. Take a look at it, recently there have been few
changes related to the ALS settings. Probably they are not needed given
that you are able to set the threshold with the current kernel driver,
but you might find something interesting.

I'll submit a patch to correct the documentation, thanks for reporting.
