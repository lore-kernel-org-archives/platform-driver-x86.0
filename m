Correct.

> Hans, you said you'd send a v6 once that was squared away I believe.

Yes, I need to brush these patches of and send a new version.

Do you want me to also send out a new version of the platform patches when
I send the next shot at the LED side of things, or shall I keep those
in my personal tree until the LED api is finalized ?

Ack.
