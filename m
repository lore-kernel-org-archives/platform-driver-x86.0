That should be fairly easy to implement. For now, given that only Elan
and Synaptics are the one in need for Host Notify, it could be better to
request the Host Notify IRQ instead of disabling it unconditionally
(which would make the current yet 8 years old lis3lv02d driver happy
again).

No, there is nothing special. Same situation for Elan with their latest
touchpads over PS/2. There is just a knowledge from the driver that
there is a device connected on a Host Notify capable bus on a specific
address. To give you an idea, on Windows, the Synaptics (and Elan)
driver even ships the equivalent of i2c-i801 to be sure to have one
driver for it...
So the knowledge is all in the driver.

Benjamin
