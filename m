Given this is a significant functional change, as opposed to a bug fix, I'm
leaning toward reverting the original and adding back the corrected version to
3.20. I'm going to look at the total impact first - let me know if you have a
strong argument one way or the other.

Why would the als_enabled file exist if it would return ENODEV? If it shouldn't,
then returning ENODEV in both cases would be the right thing to do as there is
an error present.
