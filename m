When a key is pressed and released, KBC sends a pair of corresponding
scancode - a make and a break. In normal case, a make code and a break
code differ in one bit - break =3D make | BIT7. Therefore, a scancode
with BIT7 set is a break. There are special cases such as super key
that maps to "0xe0 0x5b" and "0xe0 0xdb" where 0xe0 is present for
both make and break, but 0x5b and 0xdb follow the same pattern.

Scancode 0x88 is a break code (i.e. release), and each scancode must
be unique and should not used for different purposes.

I have not received any feedbacks but I don't think holiday is quite
over for everybody. I will send updates when there is any.
