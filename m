The brightness button hookup is in userspace, and odds are that's not
working right, you need newer gnome to handle that.

But, when you insert this with "debug=1" does the screen turn off and
then on?

You can also go into the /sys/class/backlight/samsung/ directory and
mess with the backlight values in the files to see if it gets brighter
and dimmer.  If that works, then the driver is working properly.

I'll work on getting the "force" thing to work properly, as I think I'll
just enable this for all Samsung laptops as Matthew recommends.
