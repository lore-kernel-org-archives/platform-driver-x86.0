I have no specific objection to making it 0444, but in general I'd
rather expose less information to unprivileged users rather than more.
I'm also having trouble imagining what an unprivileged user would do
with the MOF -- it's useful for reverse engineering and it may
eventually be useful for making WMI calls from userspace, but neither
of those is particularly useful to unprivileged users.
