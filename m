Thanks Andy, I'll keep that in mind and see if I can come up with something to
address it while working on WMI this week.

The other problem with wmi-mof is that there will be no immediate open source
consumers of the interface, and none on the horizon. We can't even test it to
any meaningful degree on Linux. I suspect this will be met with stiff
resistance.
