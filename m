 From the discussion below, it seems that this system does not implement the new
WMI scheme ( which is when dell_new_hk_type=true is set). So, at issue here is the
legacy code. Without knowing exactly why BIOS would behave differently in this particular case,
the fix seems arbitrary. Let me see if I can get hold of the BIOS developer(if possible) and provide feedback in this thread.

Islam Amer

   Can you attach dmidecode output from the system here?

Thanks..
