Ok, by clkdev design if a device is passed but there isn't a
match in the lookup table it allows it to match based solely on
the connection id. Given that the connection id is globally
unique this will work.

Hopefully we don't have two of these devices with pmc_plt_clk_<n>
signals in a single system though. Then having the device name
would help differentiate between the two. And then it may make
sense to have some sort of ACPI lookup system, similar to how we
have lookups for clks in DT.
