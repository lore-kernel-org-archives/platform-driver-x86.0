I think the reason is that rfkill-input only has a global concept of
per-device states. The alternative would be to force a newly registered
rfkill device to the state that was set by rfkill-input.

Is it possible that acer-wmi reports both a hotkey event _and_ an rfkill
event?

I don't think this makes sense. Until distros routinely ship an rfkill
daemon, we absolutely need rfkill-input.

I disagree -- let's discuss more first.

What really happens on Acer machines when the user presses a button?
Does it generate more than one event?
