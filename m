I really have a hard time to understand the usefulness of this.

All I can see so far is detecting that something went wrong. So if this
happens once per day all the user gets is a completely useless line in
dmesg. Even if that message comes more often, it still tells only that
something went wrong without the slightest information about the potential
root cause.

There are more issues with this: If there is a hrtimer scheduled on that
last CPU which enters the idle freeze state and that timer is 10 minutes
away, then the check timer can't be programmed and the system will happily
stay for 10 minutes in some shallow C state without notice. Not really
useful.

You know upfront whether the i915 power wells (or whatever other machinery)
is not powered off to allow the system to enter a specific power state. If
you think hard enough about creating infrastructure which allows you to
register power related facilities and then check them in that idle freeze
enter state, then you get immediate information WHY this happens and not
just the by chance notification about the fact that it happened.

I might be missing something, but aside of the issues I have with the
tick/clockevents abuse, this looks like some half baken ad hoc debugging
aid of dubious value.

Thanks,
