It was added due to an oops, waaaaay back then.  If it is not needed
anymore, and there is zero chance of the kthread still being active when
hotkey_poll_stop_sync() ends, hotkey_thread_mutex can be simply removed.

Note that hotkey_thread_data_mutex is still required.

Looks like it, if the current semanthics of ktread_stop() are syncronous.
