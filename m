Thank's for you also reserve time to trace it. And, I also add comment

>=20

Yes, that because the following patch introduce
driver with persistent state will affect the global state only if rfkil=
l-input
is enabled:

http://git.kernel.org/?p=3Dlinux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=3D=
commit;h=3Db3fa1329eaf2a7b97124dacf5b663fd51346ac19

It maybe workaround another rfkill-input issue, but causes it replicate=
 acer-wmi's=20
bluetooth killswitch initial state (or any driver that used rfkill_init=
_sw_state)=20
to any new bluetooth killswitch.

It's not make sense.

>=20

Yes, brightness-up key is another story, maybe you can enable acpi debu=
g
to look at montior which acpi method or _Q event method used:

echo 0xFFFFFFFF >/sys/module/acpi/parameters/debug_layer
echo 0xF >/sys/module/acpi/parameters/debug_level

But, this is not related to our current killswitch issue, let us skip
it.

>=20

I agreed your point, and I don't think rfkill-input need enable for all
non-Expert user because it sometimes have conflict with EC or userland
behavior.

I still suggest you can disable rfkill-input then please try Gary Lin's
urfkill daemon, it can do what does rfkill-input do and more
flexibility.

>=20

The root cause is what I said in the above, it's hard to fix in kernel
module because user only can choice enable/disable rfkill-input in
Kconfig and even cann't choice it when system boot.

I thought we need:
 - set rfkill-input to EXPERT, remove !EXPERT
 - add a kernel option to rfkill for user can choice enable it or not
when system boot.
 - Add comment in Documentation/rfkill.txt for remind user can use
urfkill daemon (or any other userland daemon) to replace rfkill-input.

Of course need rfkill experts' more professional comments for this
topic.
I will try to generate a patches to implement the above 3 things then
send out to rfkill experts for review.


Thank's a lot!
