sysfs is the quick and easy to handle option.  The single file per axis
is because you need a surprisingly complex description to explain the
contents of a 'scan' across all axis.  There are plenty of devices out
there that don't conform to the simple x y z coordinates.  If you do
it with one file per reading this is clearly handled in the naming.

Obviously if you want high frequency data with the samples grouped
across various axes, the single attribute per axis isn't all that
helpful.  However if you want this you are likely to want to use input
(if appropriate) or perhaps IIO see below but basically we are interested
in a wide range of sensors including some that are quicker than ever
makes sense for input devices and hence have a much simpler path to
userspace.  (different aims = different solution!)

Quite a few discussions have taken place on standardizing this in the past.
I've cc'd Hemanth and IIO to cover the main contributors (IIRC).

The general view is that if it really is used primarily for 'input' e.g.
a human deliberately doing stuff with it to manipulate software, then it
should be via input.  Other forms of accelerometer and uses such as freefall
are more dubious.  Freefall definitely isn't deliberate user input (most
of the time ;).  There are plenty of accelerometers that do nothing else
such as those in hard disks.  Even if we have multiple sensors why on
earth would a userspace app want to treat them independently? Hence
a single chrdev seems more than adequate to me

We have a lot of the more interesting devices in iio (staging/iio/accel).
Fun things such as vibration sensors (extremely high frequency short period
sampling) an impact sensors alongside some conventional accelerometers.
Free fall is an area we don't have well covered though.  Actually
it's handled as a generic all axis low value threshold (which is what they
typically actually are up to some filtering - handling description of
filtering is still on the todo list!).  Note we are covering a much
wider range of sensors that just accelerometers so needed something
that generalized. On that front we have a lot of relatively tightly
defined interfaces that cover most things I've seen on these sensors.

As we are still in staging, we are mostly happy to discuss any new
proposals, but note that if we change anything for accelerometers we will
also have to change it for every other sensor type so that is the angle
I for one will be approaching new discussions from.
Consistency is a pain sometimes!

Anyhow, some references to previous related discussions:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2010/9/21/167 (iio sysfs event control attribute naming -
docs in tree are more up to date drivers/staging/iio/Documentation/sysfs-bus-iio)

https://lkml.org/lkml/2010/5/21/30 (Hemanth's CMA3000 accelerometer driver).

Change of direction is much more likely to be deliberate human interaction
than freefall. I'm not convinced the same solutions will apply.

Probably, though please cc linux-iio as it's clearly relevant there as well
and a heads up to lkml that the discussion is starting might also bring
in a few others.

Good to see someone else is trying to start a discussion around this.
I hope you get more input than some of the previous ones have had!
