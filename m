Hello,

This patchset implements a fan control for asus notebooks.
It's based on Felipe Contreras' patch
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/10/8/800), that was proposed one and a half
year ago, but never made it to the kernel, because of the use of
"virt_to_phys".
This problem is solved by using the acpi internal function that is
activated by the first patch (ACPI_FUTURE_USAGE is removed).
The second patch implements the actual fan control functions, with a
similar logic than Felipe, but using hwmon instead of the thermal
interface and some bugs removed.

This patchset contains the following 2 patches:
0001-ACPI-activate-export-acpi_os_get_physical_address.patch
0002-asus-wmi-add-fan-control.patch

This is my first kernel patch. I tried to respect all style rules and
implement it properly. I couldn't find any try to fix the old patch in
recent time, thus I wrote this new patch.

I would appreciate any kind of feedback to get this patch upstream.
