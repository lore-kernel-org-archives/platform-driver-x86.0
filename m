Thanks for this information, it can be useful indeed.

In fact, this set of patches is a rewrite of the first RFC set, where
we discussed that arch/x86/platform/ could be a good place, as the
TS-5500 is a specific platform with its platform devices (the
corresponding thread is here: https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/5/3/60).
