Thanks for an update. Few comments below.

(Keep in mind, please, that we are not expecting new version
immediately, and Rafael might also apply this one without changes,
since they are minors)

Just a nit: perhaps add this before module.h ?

I'm not sure force is a good name here, perhaps "locked"?
Btw, would it be boolean?

list_for_each_entry()

Perhaps you meant empty line followed by return statement.

Perhaps move "battery:" to pr_fmt() ?
I have counted already 3 prints with it and see more below.

Ditto.

Ditto.

Apparently you didn't apply -M -C (perhaps with some non-default
threshold) to avoid such thing in the patch.

> --- /dev/null

Ditto.
