Correct, from my testing (with limited sample size) and AML code: 5th
and 6th generation devices have a non-zero OEM platform revision,
whereas 3rd and 4th gen. devices do not have any (i.e. result will be
NULL).

Since we always expect a non-zero platform revision (for 5th/6th gen.),
we can initialize it to zero and use that as "unknown"/"not available".
So if it can not be determined, we return NODEV.
