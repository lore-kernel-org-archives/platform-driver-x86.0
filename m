Nice, in your older mail I read:

That event (0xd0) is probably a custom event announced through ATIF.
I'm working on the code to deal with it, the latest patches are here:

http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2012-July/025646.html

You first need this one with the ACPI header:
http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2012-July/025517.html

and the other 3 that you've already tested. With my patches on top you
should be able to change the brightness using the hotkeys.

I'd be grateful if you could test them :-)
