Hi Colin,

[Matthew, everybody from the platform list, please see

thread]

Sorry, took me a while to get back to your email.

I'm pretty sure this one's at fault, see below.

See, iwlwifi just reports this from the hw.

And your BT USB device shows up on the bus too. But then:

> iwlagn 0000:0b:00.0: RF_KILL bit toggled to disable radio.

> usb 4-2: USB disconnect, address 4

iwlwifi reports that it was killed, and your BT USB device disappears.

All the commits you listed are related to iwlwifi only. However, we can
see that both wifi and BT are killed again. Therefore, iwlwifi can't be
at fault (its rfkill line is basically a GPIO input, it can't cause BT
to drop from the bus).

The consequence is that the fault must be with dell_laptop, the BIOS is
the only thing that can be causing both to be rf-killed. (I'd also
suspect rfkill, but it has no changes since 2.6.37)
