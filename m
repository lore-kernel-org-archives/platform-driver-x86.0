Hi everyone (Thinkpad-ACPI, ACPI, and Power supply maintainers),

some might know that I presented a patch set adding support for
charge thresholds to thinkpad_acpi about 1.5 years ago. 

Back then, one of the major rejections was that the functionality
for setting charge thresholds should be integrated into the
power supply stack somehow. I did not know who to contact back
then, but know I re-read MAINTAINERS and found all your addresses,
so I give it a second try.

One issue with just integrating it in the current battery
directories would be that ThinkPads are able to set charge
thresholds for batteries that are currently not inserted.

Back then I wrote:

If you, the ACPI and power supply people, have any preferred
way (or any idea at all how) to proceed, that would be useful,
so I don't start working on it again, and then somebody does
not like it.

Regards,

Julian
