So a big part of the reason to punt the decision on which input
devices to enable this auto-inhibit is that we don't really have
information about those relationsships / device-links you are
suggesting here.  libinput is already doing inhibiting inside
userspace for e.g. the tablet-mode switch but it relies on heuristics
+ quirk tables to decide which keyboards should be inhibited and which
not.

E.g. for a 360 degree hinges 2-in-1 we want to disable the builtin
keyboard, when folded into in tablet mode, but not any external ones.

Mostly the builtin kbd will be PS2 but I have one such 2-in-1 here
in my home office with a USB kbd ...

In general of the master devices there will be only 1, there will be
only 1 lid switch and only 1 tablet-mode switch. So my idea with the
auto_inhibit_ev_sw_mask, is for it to be a per input-device setting.

So using your terms, all input devices with the (1 << SW_LID) bit
set in their auto_inhibit_ev_sw_mask will be dependents of the
(master) device which actually is reporting the SW_LID bit.

The idea here is for this to work the same as how the rfkill code
from net/rfkill/input.c works, except instead of binding e.g.
KEY_WLAN to toggling the sw-state of rfkill devices with a type
of RFKILL_TYPE_WLAN. This will bind SW_LID to inhibiting input
devices with the SW_LID bit set in their auto_inhibit_ev_sw_mask.

Hans
