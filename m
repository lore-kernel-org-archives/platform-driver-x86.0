Actually, what I was thinking of is already implemented: when auto_mic
is turned on, num_adc_nids is set to one, so there are no extra ADCs. I
think we can get away (at least for now) with just an extra check that
there are no extra ADCs (added in v2 of the patch).

Thanks!

Perhaps other people on this list have a better overview than I, but I
get the feeling that at least the mute LED is quite common on Thinkpads.
The micmute LED perhaps not so much.

Ok.

Ok, added in v2.
