Since it is shipped with Win8, I think the following patch should take
care of it:
[PATCH] ACPI / video: Use native backlight control interface by default
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-acpi/msg47755.html

Last time Daniel seems to agree to merge it for test purpose, but I
didn't see it get merged somewhere yet.

Thanks,
Aaron
