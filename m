yes correct.

basically that vendor parameter forces acpi to give up backlight control
to the platform driver.

This is a known issue (at least to me) but it shouldn't really be a
problem as it existed for quite some time. Reading the brightness level
at boot returns an uninitialized value so the driver displays that
negative number. After echoing below you should see the actual value you
set.

this looks ok. I'm wondering if the nouveau driver may be getting in the
way somehow or if I broke backlight support in sony-laptop.

Can you try applying the sony-laptop patches on 3.2, boot with
acpi_backlight=vendor and see what is the state there?

there are various (potentially conflicting) ways to control the
brightness levels, acpi, platform and raw (via the video driver).
