A bit of trouble parsing... to be clear, your preference would be that for the
PNP0C14 on whitelisted platforms (either DMI matches, or possibly via the ACPI
Device UID?) we expose every GUID (Method, Event, and Data) for that device to
userspace?

The concern raised here is that for systems using dell-wmi, the two GUIDs used
by the kernel would also be exposed to userspace. Is this correct?

Is this a problem because there are a lot of them, or because they routinely
change?

Also, are these something that could be part of a debug feature, or do they need
to be in production so you can work with customers to diagnose running systems
for example?
