My ASUS F3Jv-AS022P (Core 2 Duo T7200, 2 GB RAM, BIOS version
207) has trouble (read: it reboots within one second of the
vmlinuz being loaded) with recent kernels as well.

While I haven't performed a full bisection yet (which is why=20
I didn't try reporting the problem until I saw this thread),
I have narrowed down the problem by compiling several tagged
versions:
* 2.6.35 series: .4 and .6 boot successfully, .8 and .10 fail;
* 2.6.36 series: -rc2 boots successfully, .1 fails;
* 2.6.37 series: -rc4 fails.


I can perform further testing if needed.


Regards,
Lionel.
