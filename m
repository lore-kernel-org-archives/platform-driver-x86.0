On the Toshiba Tecra Z40, after a suspend-to-disk, some FN hotkeys
driven by toshiba_acpi are not functional.

Calling the ACPI object ENAB on resume makes them back alive.

Hi guys,

we noticed this problem on a Toshiba Z40. I kind of brute-forced the thing, and
I ended up that calling "ENAB" was making the keys working again (rmmod/insmod 
the driver was sufficient, and the only command which was different from the
resume was this ACPI call).

I am really surprised some toshiba laptops do not need this, so I'd prefer that
an ACPI expert (Matthew???) gives its wisdom regarding that.

Cheers,
Benjamin
