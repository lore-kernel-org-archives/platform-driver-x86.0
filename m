Actually this doesn't work. When I unblock the SW switch by=20
calling `rfkill unblock <number of acer-bluetooth>`, it unblocks the SW=
=20
killswitch, the bluetooth LED goes up, the hci0 shows-up (USB device an=
d=20
killswitch), but initial state of hci0's killswitch is "blocked". So I =
still=20
need to unblock it manually. I would preffer to don't be forced to do s=
tep 2,=20
also for the HW switch (which should do the same job I think).
