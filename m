Can't we make the simpler patch be to just not spam the logs? Do it
once, and forget about it. Maybe make the timeouts long enough to make
sure that there are no other downsides from having the driver
occasionally testing if it's back?

I *detest* hardware-specific blacklists. They are impossible to
maintain, and we've had the situation more than once that we fixed the
real bug that caused the blacklist in the first place, but the entry
stays around because nobody knows/cares/tests it.
