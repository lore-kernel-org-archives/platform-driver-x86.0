That's only because a researcher discovered it too.  MS doesn't formally pr=
ovide
any documented support for extracting from binary MOF.

>=20

I haven't done any analysis of it so I'm not really sure how complex it wil=
l be.
For now I'd say userspace should be planned to handle it until someone dete=
rmines
A simple enough way to decompile it that can live in the kernel.

I meant that to say that at least for now Andy's wmi-mof driver should stil=
l be merged.
If something is going to build on top of this to do WBEM tools, they'll nee=
d that MOF
data once someone figures out how to nicely deconstruct it.
