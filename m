I don't want to nag, but just so it doesn't drop off
the TODO list due to "lack of interest":  What's the
status?  Will Santa bring the the TI Dollar Cove PMIC driver?

While I'm at it, I also have questions about S0ix support
in Linux which I didn't find answers to by web search.
Does S0ix depend on the PMIC driver?  And will it be
used during run time or only in "sleep" state
(which would mean "echo freeze >/sys/power/state"
since ACPI S3 isn't supported)?
Now all I know is it doesn't seem to be used so far (running 4.9.0-rc7+):

/sys/kernel/debug/pmc_atom/sleep_state:S0IR Residency:  0us
/sys/kernel/debug/pmc_atom/sleep_state:S0I1 Residency:  0us
/sys/kernel/debug/pmc_atom/sleep_state:S0I2 Residency:  0us
/sys/kernel/debug/pmc_atom/sleep_state:S0I3 Residency:  0us
/sys/kernel/debug/pmc_atom/sleep_state:S0   Residency: 160934496us


Thanks,
Johannes
