I think there is no problem with more /dev/freefall devices. With these
Dell drivers it should not happen as only one driver can request IRQ
which is associated with /dev/freefall. And /dev/freefal is registered
after acquiring IRQ.

But... there are other problems with it as wrote in previous emails.
