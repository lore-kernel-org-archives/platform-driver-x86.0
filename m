Right, this is now well documented and also the latest changes to the firmware
API have made the sysfs fallback loader an option through a sysctl knob. The
code should be much easier to follow and test now.

Indeed, this is now acknowledged in the latest Kconfig for the firmware loader.

The firmwared solution capturing uevents and using the sysfs fallback
mechanism should resolve this. Its also now properly documented on the
firmware loader Kconfig.

Indeed, this is now documented on the Kconfig too.

The firmwared solution seems to be the way to go for now.
