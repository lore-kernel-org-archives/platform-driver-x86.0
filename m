A full kernel log up to including post-initrd loading of gmux would be
useful.

As far as I have seen nouveau should not be doing unneeded vgaarb
operations by itself (though userspace might be) as opposed to closed
nvidia driver.

If your systems allows, try booting to init=/bin/bash, then check for
backlight, load nouveau, check for backlight and finally load gmux and
check backlight (putting i915 in the mix where initrd/userspace puts
it would be nice).

Thanks,
Bruno
