AFAICT the SYS_THERMx thermistors all go to the PMC838C PMIC on the
T14s. The EC thermistors are on a separate page, search for "RT8203" for
example.

I'm not sure why this mirroring exists, but even QC's Hamoa/X1E CRD has
that. IIRC it is not always there though, the Purwa/X1P CRD has the
sensors only connected to the EC (maybe for some minor cost savings?).

I believe on some devices the OS (Windows/Linux) even needs to send
temperatures (e.g. CPU/GPU temperature) to the EC for it to work
correctly. Not sure if the T14s needs/uses that though. I was mostly
looking at the CRD thermal setup a year ago...

I captured the above while actively stressing the CPU, so presumably the
SoC was heating up more quickly than the charging in that situation.
Just a few minutes earlier it was like this in idle state with charging
indeed warmer than SoC:

| Sensor          | EC (hwmon)   | PMIC (thermal)  | Delta    |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|----------|

| Base / Back     | 33.0°C       | 31.9°C          | +1.1°C   |
| Charging        | 37.0°C       | 38.2°C          | -1.2°C   |

Agreed.

I'm not sure about the fan speed, I never checked properly but my gut
feeling is that the fan runs faster in Windows and never runs full speed
in Linux. (Are there fan profiles maybe? Not sure. Maybe I'm imagining
it. :-))

Right, it's all quite complicated. :/ Ideally, we would be able to
figure out the exact thresholds for the fan control in the EC firmware,
so that we can set the throttling temperature to be shortly above that..
