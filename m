Thank you for your suggestion.  I agree with you.  I'll try to make a
new patch again.

The reason is to restore transflective status, which is always disabled
after resuming.  If BL_CORE_SUSPENDRESUME is added,
set_lcd_state_status() is called from backlight_update_status() with
stored brightness. So, when its brightness is 0, transflective status is
enabled after resuming.
