Sure, but there are 2 existing users of an array of acpi_device_id-s
combined with an acpi_match_device_ids() call and both have the array
inside the function, so for consistency it seems better to keep it
where it is.

Agreed, will fix for v4.

It seems that all variants one can come up with are already used inside
this single file.

I agree that less is more, so I will change this to:

         static const struct acpi_device_id i2c_multi_instantiate_ids[] = {
                 {"BSG1160", },
                 {}
         };

For v4.

Regards,

Hans
