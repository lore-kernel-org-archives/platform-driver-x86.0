The parameter we're talking about is wapf, it's directly linked to WAPF
in the dsdt. WAPF is a bitmask used to control the behavior of the toggle key.
It can: control the device,  control the leds, send key codes.

Here is some doc about what we found on wapf:
https://dev.iksaif.net/projects/acpi4asus/wiki/Asus-laptop_WAPF

By default, we currently write 1 into wapf, because this is the value that
works correctly most of the time. But on some models, the key won't do
anything if you don't set the correct value of wapf.

On windows, the hotk acpi driver (from asus) also sets WAPF, but
if seems to do some hardware check to guess the value to use ... Then
it also handles events, and do actions (toggle wlan devices, etc...).

But all the WAPF/BLED/WLED stuff on asus-laptop isn't really working
properly, mainly because I lacks documentation, and the behavior seems
to be dependent of present hardware (wlan cards mainly).

Because we should consider the BIOS as a fallback method (that may or
may not work). If a newer model comes out, and the kernel/userspace doesn't
know how to handle it, users will be able to use the BIOS while the
driver is being fixed.
