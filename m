Ok. Desktop wants to control the backlight, because it makes sense to
turn it off when the screen is blanked, and dim it when screen is
dimmed. Situation is quite similar to display backlight, actually.

Ok, and this is where the problems start. You are not supposed to
control keyboard backlight like that. (In the same way you can't
control display backlight like that.)

There are numerous problems with the shell script:

1) how to identify the keyboard backlight LED

2) there may be more then one

3) synchronization problems

4) need to be root

Your shell script should talk to the desktop, because it already knows
where the backlight is, and the problems disappear.

I believe the confusion is not worth it. Talk to the desktop people,
there should be good way to control the backlight without reaching
lowlevel interfaces directly.

Because you want to play multiple patterns on the LED.

You probably also want to automatically control the keyboard backlight
LEDs using ambient light sensor. Shell should not be involved.

This is one example of automatic backlight / keyboard backlight / LED
patterns. And yes, this should be integrated with desktop, not using
/sys/class/leds directly.
