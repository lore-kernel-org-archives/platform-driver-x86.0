It is way simpler and more straightforward if hda_intel.c calls
pci_is_thunderbolt_attached() directly, as I've suggested above.

The DRM drivers call that as well and register with vga_switcheroo
only if it returns false.  So if hda_intel.c asked vga_switcheroo
and got back a negative answer, it would never know whether it's
because the DRM driver hasn't finished probing yet, or it's module
is blacklisted, or whatever.

vga_switcheroo doesn't do the filtering, the DRM drivers themselves
decice whether to register with vga_switcheroo or not.  The motivation
is to avoid middle layers and instead provide the DRM drivers with
a library of helpers that they may call at their own discretion.
