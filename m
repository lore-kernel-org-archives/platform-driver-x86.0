This is an update to the patches I sent previously to enable hotkeys on
many Toshiba models that aren't supported by the code currently in
toshiba_acpi. Once agains, here's the high-level summary:

 * Add support for reading scancodes using the INFO method when
   avaialable and for generating hotkey notifications by filtering Fn
   key presses from the keyboard
 * Adds a new EC interface allowing toshiba_acpi to get a handle to the
   EC, which is needed because the NTFY method used to generate the
   hotkey notifications is in the EC namespace
 * Support some additional hotkey scancodes
 * Blacklist hotkey support for some Satellite models due to a buggy
   implementation of the INFO method on this model

The only change since v1 is to add additional machines to the hotkey
blacklist. These machines were identified by scraping bug reports to
identify machines with the same INFO method implementation in their
DSDTs.

Thanks,
Seth
