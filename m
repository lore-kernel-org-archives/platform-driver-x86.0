Probably it's too early to ask, but did you go for the E200HA
or what device are you going to use?  And did you start poking
at it, or what timeframe can we expect some patches to test?

BTW, just to clarify about the test patches I added in bugzilla:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=193891
You can use them but I also don't mind if they go to the
garbage can, they were just quickly cobbled together
for testing.


Thanks,
Johannes
