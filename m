Hi,

This is the third version of my proposal to add reference handling to
the software node code. In this version I renamed ACPI_NAME_SIZE to
ACPI_NAMESEG_SIZE in 6/13, and slit patch 9/13 in two separate patches
(9/13 and 10/13) as suggested by Andy. Patch 9/13 will now only move
the registration of max17047 out of probe, and 10/13 will introduce
the software nodes.

v2 commit message:

This is the second version of this series. In this version I'm
introducing a new helper device_find_child_by_name() as proposed
by Andy. Andy requested also another helper that could be used for
chaining the fwnodes, but I decided not to add that now. I would like
to still think about how we should handle exceptions like if there
already is a secondary node assigned for a node.

v1 commit message:

This series adds support for software fwnode reference handling. In
practice it means making fwnode_property_get_reference_args() function
usable in the drivers also with software nodes. I send the series
originally as RFC [1].

As the first user for the software node references, I'm converting
intel_cht_int33fe.c to use them as part of the series.
