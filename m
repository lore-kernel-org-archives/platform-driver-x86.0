Firstly, the MFD main branch is not immutable.

Secondly, you cannot simply pull a patch in from another tree.  All of
the patches before it and your local base will be pulled in too.  This
is why we create purposely created immutable branches which *only*
contain the patches required by other repos.

There are no valid reason to create an IB for this case.
