Agreed, this one should not go back to stable.

These sound like good candidates, real bugs that bother people. I would support
sending them back to stable.

Since we didn't have this discussion before they went mainline, sorry it's been
a bad month for me :-/, these need to be sent manually. Pali, Gabriele, please
have a look at stable_kernel_rules, determine how far back these should go, and
submit the patches to the stable list.

They didn't bother me at the time as I saw the improvement, but they weren't
enough to make the stable decision and I need to watch out for that in the
future. Lesson learned :-)

Thanks everyone,
