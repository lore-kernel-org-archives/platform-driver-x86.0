Pegatron Lucid tablet sends an ACPI hotkey event(0xEA) when the
accelerometer detects coarse orientation change. My initial thought was
to just translate this event into KEY_DIRECTION, which seems to be the
norm from what we can see in hp-wmi driver. (See patch below for an
implementation.)

But this isn't just a key per se like on the HP touchsmart tablet, this
is an event that is triggered when the device is rotated.

This could be defined as a new Misc (EV_MSC) event:
MSC_ORIENTATION_CHANGED ?

Or we could use the upcoming IIO subsystem which is supposed to be for
sensors, but then we'd have a mismatch between the device based on ACPI
with firmware in the middle (driver submitted by Andy Ross) and the
purpose of IIO ("SPI or I2C device").


Maybe I'm over-thinking this and this might be just right:

Subject: [PATCH RFC] asus-laptop: Send input key for tablet rotation on Pegatron Lucid Tablet

Pegatron Lucid tablet sends ACPI event on coarse orientation changes.
Translate this into KEY_DIRECTION input event.

Please note that this patch depends on Andy Ross's first patch in order for
asus-laptop to bind with the tablet.
