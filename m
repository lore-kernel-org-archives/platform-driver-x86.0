Thanks, that is useful info and the kinda info I would
expect in a cover-letter :)

I see. Makes me wonder though how that -ENODEV is a problem,
it is weird. But is it a problem?

The v1 patch writes the following about this:

"This makes the modalias sysfs read fail and suppresses the device
add uevent, even though the device is registered and bound to its driver."

Ok, but the backlight driver ultimately ends up adding a
/sys/class/backlight device which I assume does get
a uevent, or is the problem that one never getting a uevent
because of its parent not getting one ?

And the lenovo-yoga-tab2-pro-1380-fastcharger driver does all
it needs to do fully in kernel and does not even export
a userspace interface.

With that said given that there are TODO comments for this
I guess addressing the TODO-s is ok.

Ack.

The idea was to make this a generic match mechanism / helper
function busses can call, like the current of and acpi
match (and modalias) helpers. And then have matching by
a compatible string instead of by name since matching by name
only works if there is only 1 instance.

Anyways this is just an idea and somewhat out of scope for
this patch-set.

Hans
