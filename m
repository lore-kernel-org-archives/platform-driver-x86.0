Hi,
While trying to understand how wmi work (in fact, it's very easy :) ),
I wrote a small utility to dump _WDG.
It's really usefull to see what GUID are present in a dsdt when you
don't have the hardware and to find the
object_id associated with this GUID.

You can grab it here: http://xf.iksaif.net/dev/wmidump.html

I mostly stole some code from wmi.c and added some printf :).
