Exactly! If you are reimplementing logic from another project, it is
strong hint that you are doing something wrong.=20

No, you should autoconfigure it, actually. See N900, there are 6 leds
controlling one backlight.

Actually, poll will not help you. If both your script and desktop
access the LED at the same time, there will be races. ("Hmm. I just
wrote to the brightness file, and received poll notification. What is
the current brightness?")

Do you have a link?

And I don't want led/brightness file to be used for interprocess
communication. I especially don't want to deal with _6_ keyboard led
files to be used for interprocess communication -- what is desktop
expected to do when you set different brightnesses to each of them?

You don't want to deal with desktop API, yet expect all the desktops
to follow your prefferred API (poll on led/brightness?).

There should be one component controlling the keyboard backlight. Your
scripts should talk to that component.
