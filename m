Hi All,

There are various issues with how the linux kernel currently select which
firmware backlight control (*) method to use:

1) There are various module loading ordering issues, leading to different
behavior depending on module load ordering:

* http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-acpi/msg50443.html
* Sometimes we register and immediately unregister the acpi_video# backlight
  devices, some ACPI implementations don't like this, so we've special
  quirks to avoid the register + unregister on some machines

2) There are 2 main kernel commandline options involved acpi_backlight and
video.use_native_backlight. With the latter only working if certain firmware
checks succeed *and* the former has the right value. This is confusing not
only for end users but also for people trying to read the code in question.
Note some vendor specific firmware backlight drivers, ie thinkpad_acpi.c
have their own related options, leading to 3 kernel cmdline options coming
into play.

3) We have quirks everywhere. I'm afraid we cannot get rid of these, but
at least we should try to clean up where they live and how they interact
with each other. acpi_backlight=vendor quirks mostly live in vendor specific
firmware backlight drivers. But we also have a couple in acpi/video_detect.c.
video.use_native_backlight=1 quirks otoh live in acpi/video.c.

In the end all these options and quirks all work together in a complicated
manor to achieve one simple goal: decide which firmware interface to use
for backlight control (*). Which comes down to choosing between the
following 3 options:

1 Native (raw) backlight control (so no firmware backlight control)
2 Control by the standard acpi-video firmware backlight driver
3 Control by a vendor specific firmware backlight driver

So I would like to propose to give the acpi_backlight= kernel commandline
option which currently accepts values "vendor" and "video" a third value
"native", and to get rid of the video.use_native_backlight option.

This would be combined with a major cleanup of the existing code for
firmware backlight control method selection:

1) Replace the ACPI_VIDEO_BACKLIGHT_* flags with an enum listing the 3 options
2) Replace the acpi_video_support variable with
   acpi_backlight_method_cmdline and acpi_backlight_method_dmi variables,
   both initialzed to -1
3) Add an acpi_backlight_method() function which will:
  - return acpi_backlight_method_cmdline if not -1; else
  - return acpi_backlight_method_dmi if not -1; else
  - return ACPI_BACKLIGHT_NATIVE if acpi_osi_is_win8(); else
  - return ACPI_BACKLIGHT_VIDEO if supported; else
  - return ACPI_BACKLIGHT_VENDOR
4) Have all drivers that use acpi_video_dmi_promote_vendor move their
   quirks for this to acpi/video_detect.c, removing the need for them to
   call acpi_video_dmi_promote_vendor() and acpi_video_unregister(), removing
   the load ordering issues and removing them depending on video.ko
5) Switch all drivers from acpi_video_backlight_support() to
   acpi_backlight_method()

The plan would be to do 1-3 in a single patch and ASAP and then do 4 and 5
driver by driver, and once done remove acpi_video_dmi_promote_vendor() and
acpi_video_backlight_support(), and mark acpi_video_register /
acpi_video_unregister as "only for i915 use".

Regards,

Hans


*) Note I'm only talking about controlling the actual brightness of the
backlight, not detecting brighness/backlight hotkey presses, there are
similar issues there. But I believe that that should be treated as an
orthogonal problem which should be fixed independently of this.
