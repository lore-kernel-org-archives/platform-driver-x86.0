Yes, I have the same feeling. The problem is that I have no idea what happen after
writing.

Oh, maybe I choose wrong word. Usually after some I/O writing, we have to wait for
some signal or time to make sure device complete operation. But it seems reading
right after writing. This is not important, just some nagging..

Sorry, I took some day off for a rest. And thank you, you did exactly
what I plan to do. From your log the values of BTST/BTEN match what it
shall be.

Your log tells a lot. It tells me if the bluetooth init failed. Then we
have to turning off and power on again by hw switch to make it alive again.

So, I believe we have two issue here.
* when rfkill unblock, sometimes bluetooth init failed.
* power up system after rfkill block bluetooth, sometimes the cfgbit = 0xc0000
Am I correct?

I saw the USB disconnect in your log. You are right, the hw rf switch power
down the whole module.

Just check with B550, the hw rf switch power down the whole bluetooth, but
only turn off PHY for wifi. Looks like I can not take design for bluetooth
and wifi are the same. Thanks for let me check it again.
