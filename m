Let's drop this, actually.  I have mostly-working patches to make wmi
into an actual bus driver, and this intermediate step seems like it'll
just confuse people.

Question, though: where do the WMI devices belong?  Multiple choice:

/sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXSYBUS:00/PNP0C14:01/[GUID]

/sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXSYBUS:00/PNP0C14:01/wmi/[GUID]

/sys/devices/platform/PNP0C14:01/[GUID]

/sys/devices/platform/PNP0C14:01/wmi/[GUID]

Currently I've implemented the first one because it's the smallest diff.
