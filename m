Thanks for testing! Matthew has already merged the patch to his tree

That's a better question for the nouveau developers. nouveau has some
criteria it uses to determine whether or not it should supply a
backlight device, and apparently that's all passing even though the
backlight control doesn't work.

Not at this time, no.
