My personal taste is not to align struct fields (I do align enums
and such). Is this important? I would prefer to keep it how it is
but I'm not going to argue about it too much...

It is always a single EPC page.

Yes :-)

You have good point here. For sgx_tcs and sgx_secs there should not be
alignment at all as it is either in EPC or in a temporary buffer. I will
remove alignments for those.

For structs such as secinfo it makes sense to have aligment info because
you usually create them as local variables but CPU requires particular
aligment (like 64 for secinfo).

This was a really good point, thanks.

I would go with comments as it has advantages when you maintain this
code to use same fields names as SDM:

	uint64_t secs; /* Enclave Control Structure */

I wonder why they had to put that 'S' in the front :-( One thing I
would like to diverse from SDM is to use verbatim ECS as it is more
consistent naming with TCS (Thread Control Structure) and pronouncing
SECS has taken me into embarrassing situations in the past...

Have to check whether it is needed or a missing item in the SDM.

Ok.

I can update my naming in a way that for these obvious things I use
kernel naming style.

I would stick the SDM verbatim for some fields like MRENCLAVE because
it is so widely used name also in research papers etc.

For token it does not make much sense. For sigstruct the token CMAC
calculation is done over those inner structs if you run your own LE.
