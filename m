What do you mean by native list, systems that are Win8 based but don't
work with the GPU's backlight interface?
If so, it doesn't seem we have such a native list now and if we don't
make use_native_backlight=1 by default, we couldn't generate such a
list to start with...

BTW, it doesn't seem everyone agrees with this plan. May I ask, Rafael
and Daniel, what's your opinion please? We need to agree with something
to move things forward.
