I agree with Bryan on his view-point. The logic to default to Galileo Gen-1 with older-firmware.
seems reasonable to me too. We cannot for sure older Galileo Gen-1 user will upgrade to newer
version of firmware. I suspect that many will not (because lack of understanding of how
UEFI capsule can do that or lack of equipment to flash it too, especially university students). 

So for the lack of better & robust approach, the default fallback when DMI string is not
detectable to GENv1 seems reasonable.

My 2 cents.
