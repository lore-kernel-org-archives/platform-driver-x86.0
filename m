As already mentioned in my reply to the cover letter, a NACK from me for
this one.

The problem is that this causes the fwnode to be shared by all the
"struct device"-s (embedded in the i2c-clients created).

This in itself is not necessarily a problem, but it does become a
problem when combined with using device_add_properties as
intel_cht_int33fe.c does.

Since the info in the ACPI tables for devices which use this
driver is pretty terrible, we add a bunch of properties to notify
the drivers about how the different parts which make up the Type-C
functionality are tied together.

device_add_properties creates a new fwnode and then calls
set_secondary_fwnode. For devices which already have a fwnode
assigned (which the i2c-clients will have after this patch)
set_secondary_fwnode sets dev->fwnode->secondary to the fwnode
which has been newly created to hold the added properties.

Since all i2c-clients instantiated now share dev->fwnode,
the result of this is that all i2c-clients created now will
have the properties of the last i2c-client instantiated for
an acpi-node which describes multiple clients in a single
node.

Also the fwnodes created  for the properties of earlier
instantiated i2c-clients will be leaked.

I see 2 possible solutions here:

1) Changing this patch so that i2c_acpi_new_device() does:

         /*
          * The fwnode can not be shared between instantiated clients when
          * adding device-properties to the instantiated client.
          */
	if (!info->properties)
		info->fwnode = acpi_fwnode_handle(adev);

2) Leave whether info->fwnode should be set or not up to the
caller of i2c_acpi_new_device() (info is already passed in as
a param). E.g. i2c-multi-instantiate.c could do this (for now,
maybe in the future we will also want to add properties for
some HIDs).

I think that 1. is the best solution and this is all kernel internal,
so we can always revisit this if necessary.

Regards,

Hans
