Tracking the validity of the cache means we're hosed if we miss any
condition that causes the MSRs to be reset.  I think we're better off
assuming the cache can be stale at any time, i.e. don't track power
cyles and instead handle EINIT failure due to INVALID_TOKEN by writing
the cache+MSRs with the desired hash and retrying EINIT.  EINIT is
interruptible and its latency is extremely variable in any case, e.g.
tens of thousands of cycles, so this rarely-hit "slow path" probably
wouldn't affect the worst case latency of EINIT.

Ya, I expect that VMMs will preserve VM's virtual pubkey MSRs, though
there might be scenarios where a VM has direct access to the hardware
MSRs.  This is probably a moot point since I don't think we want to
assume the kernel's cache is 100% accurate, regardless of environment.
