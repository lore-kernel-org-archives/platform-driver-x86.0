OK, but by eliminating the check, supposedly certain models which do not support
illumination but do not report it via out[0], but instead via out[1], will now
attempt to use illumination - correct?

The end result being user calls to an ACPI function which at best doesn't exist
and at worst.... does, but does something entirely different.

I admit the potential for a problem is slight, but is it possible to check
something explicit for support on the newer models rather than removing an
existing check?
