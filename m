Well, right, that's just hinting that rfkill-input will be removed at
some point, hopefully!

Yeah but the hw key doesn't send key events?

I mean the whole notion of persistent rfkill state.

But is this WMI event really intended to be a key event? But ok, that
just means the reason is what you said:

Yeah, most likely.

Ah, heh, no, although we've not been able to do this I think we still
want it. But until people do routinely use urfkill, I think we can't
remove it because otherwise things just won't work right.

Right -- I've only come to understand the exact details during this
discussion myself. Alan probably modelled it on Wifi where the
disconnect issue doesn't typically appear.

So it _does_ store the state? I thought you earlier said it didn't stor=

it, and when you cold rebooted it was always disabled?

Yeah I guess we can do that, don't think it'll help much though :)
