Looking at dts files under arch/arm/boot/dts the most used name seems to be
usb_otg_vbus (with underscores) so I will use that for v2 of this patch.

As for making the name more specific, as Mark Brown has correctly pointed
out the right thing to do on x86 is to add a mapping for the consumer of the
regulator using regulator_init_data, which can be passed through platform_data
(and I do control the i2c_client instantiation on x86, so adding that is easy),
which means that we can keep the name generic, which is a much better solution
then relying on the name. This means that we can keep the name generic as
one normally does for a regulator-name.

Regards,

Hans
