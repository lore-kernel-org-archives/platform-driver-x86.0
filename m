This solution should work. It is not nice, but current mess of backligh=
t
drivers, acpi, etc, is not nice too. It will help users who already kno=
w
(or read on internet/forums/discussions) acpi_backlight=3D parameter...

It is not only that. Sometimes there are three possible ways how to
control backlight (vendor driver, acpi driver, gpu driver). And all
those driver can work, but some of them works "better".

E.g in my case on Dell Latitude E6440 all three drivers can register
backlight interface and export it to userspace via sysfs.

But the best option for *me* is to use one from dell-laptop.ko because
it has good granularity of levels for controlling backlight. Intel one
has too many levels and does not fit some linear distribution (which I
would like to see). ACPI video.ko sometimes does not work correctly wit=
h
KDE4 setting -- sometimes I need to press brightness key more times to
take effect. I do not know if this is problem of KDE or ACPI or
whatever. For me for my current desktop & kernel setup is the best
solution to use dell-laptop.ko with acpi_backlight=3Dvendor param. I do
not have to debug or change anything, just add one param to cmdline.

And I think other users (without programming knowledge) who need
immediately working laptop will use same option as me.

This is good assumption, but do not forget that there are people who:

1) do not have time to trying find out where to report bug and how
2) do not know how to report bug
3) even do not know that they can do something (like for MS systems)
