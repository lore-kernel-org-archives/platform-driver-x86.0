My concern is that if e.g. both ->open() and ->uninhibit() are provided,
then in certain circumstances ->open() won't be called:

1. users == 0
2. inhibit happens
3. input_open_device() happens, ->open() not called
4. uninhibit happens
5. as part of uninhibit ->uninhibit() is only called, but ->open() is not.

They way I understand your answer is that we implicitly impose requirements
on drivers which choose to implement e.g. both ->open() and ->uninhibit():
in such a case ->uninhibit() should be doing exactly the same things as
->open() does. Which leads to a conclusion that in practice no drivers
should choose to implement both, otherwise they must be aware that
->uninhibit() can be sometimes called instead of ->open(). Then ->open()
becomes synonymous with ->uninhibit(), and ->close() with ->inhibit().
Or, maybe, then ->inhibit() can be a superset of ->close() and
->uninhibit() a superset of ->open().

If such an approach is ok with you, it is ok with me, too.

(*)
Calling both ->inhibit() and ->close() (if they are provided) allows
drivers to go fancy and fail inhibiting (which is impossible using
only ->close() as it does not return a value, but ->inhibit() by design
does). Then ->uninhibit() is mostly for symmetry.

Andrzej
