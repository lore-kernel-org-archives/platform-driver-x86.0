+1 on the above sentiment, sense of frustration well expressed.

I went thru the same sequence of wtf-ing as Pali describes before coming
away with any level of real understanding.  IMO, this is a great example
of an issue which is 90% doc vs. 10% technical.

Hearing statements made earlier such as "the variable name doesn't matter
much" (approximate paraphrase) makes me worry, and must respectfully
disagree.  I am not involved at all in development or patches on this,
just a lowly Joe User type, and as such, can tell you that out here in
the cheap seats, the naming really does matter.

Please respect views of Pali as stated above and concentrate on documentati=
on.

As an aside from complaining though: Major tip o' the hat to all the
motivated and devoted devs on this ACPI work throughout many years;
it's really very much appreciated, despite the occasional whining (as
mine above).
