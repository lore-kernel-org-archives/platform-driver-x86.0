Yes!
Ideally, killswitch state should be independent to different driver,
even the killswitch type is the same.

But,=20
If you enabled CONFIG_RFKILL_INPUT, then rfkill_register will replicate
state for each killswitch that have the same type:

vi net/rfkill/core.c

int __must_check rfkill_register(struct rfkill *rfkill)
{
=2E..
        if (!rfkill->persistent || rfkill_epo_lock_active) {
                schedule_work(&rfkill->sync_work);
        } else {		/* if rfkill->persistent then set the state to all th=
e same type */
#ifdef CONFIG_RFKILL_INPUT	/* when CONFIG_RFKILL_INPUT =3D Y */
                bool soft_blocked =3D !!(rfkill->state & RFKILL_BLOCK_S=
W);

                if (!atomic_read(&rfkill_input_disabled))
                        __rfkill_switch_all(rfkill->type, soft_blocked)=
;	/* here call switch all to sync state */
#endif
        }

When any driver call rfkill_init_sw_state for set the initial state to
killswitch, this rfkill->persistent will set to true:

void rfkill_init_sw_state(struct rfkill *rfkill, bool blocked)	/* acer-=
wmi driver used it to set inital killswitch state */
{
=2E...
        spin_lock_irqsave(&rfkill->lock, flags);
        __rfkill_set_sw_state(rfkill, blocked);=09
        rfkill->persistent =3D true			/* persistent set to true */


That's why acer-wmi bluetooth killswitch's state was been replicate to
hci_core's killswitch state.

When CONFIG_RFKILL_INPUT set to Y, and any driver call
rfkill_init_sw_state before register rfkill, then rfkill_register will
try to sync state to the same killswitch type like the above.

It's make sense,
because rfkill-input only can block/unblock the same killswitch type at
the same time, before rfkill-input active, it want all the same type's
state is full the same.

And,
rfkill-input also suppose user only can use keycode (maybe Fn key) to
control killswitch state, so, direct use rkill tool or echo state to
killswitch for change the state will cause killswitchs' state lost link=
=2E
It like we do.

Suggest you can disable CONFIG_RFKILL_INPUT or markup the following
code. You will see the new bluetooth killswitch will be unblock when it
created.

My Acer machine have no HW bluetooth key but only have one HW WLAN key
that emit KEY_WLAN.
Please use lshal to monitor your HW bluetooth key and make sure it emit
KEY_BLUETOOTH.

Still suggest you can disable CONFIG_RFKILL_INPUT then use rfkill tool
to set acer-wmi bluetooth killswitch for test, must have different
result.


Thank's
