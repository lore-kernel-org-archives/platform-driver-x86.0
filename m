I am seeing the same issues with psmouse and SMBus touchpads. The PS/2
device knows about the availability of a better but unlisted device at
the ACPI level.

The way I solved this to not have to deal with compile/not compile and
runtime errors is the same way Wolfram told you about: bus notifiers.
I also use an intermediate platform driver to not add i2c dependency on
psmouse.

For you the solution would be:
- In dell-smo8800, after checking the whitelist, add a platform driver
  "dell-lis3lv02d-platform", and add in the platform_data the I2C address
  of the chip.
- create a new driver dell-lis3lv02d-platform.ko which listens for the
  i2c bus creation and registers the lis3lv02d I2C node when it sees a
  matching adapter. (see [1] for my solution)
- in dell-lis3lv02d-platform.ko make sure to set the irq to -ENOENT so
  that lis3lv02d.ko doesn't create /dev/freefall which will still be
  handled by ACPI.

How does that sound?

Cheers,
Benjamin
