Hi,
of course. Its good to have this chain series for anyone that needs it.

I will note that for patch 1 and the missing {} I am aware of those
fixes and implemented them myself to the downstream patch I was
carrying. I never resent a V2 because I did not address Armin's
comments. The missing {} was exposed when Armin fixed the
autodetection. So I cannot attribute those to you. Patch 2 is a review
nit, so after I fix it you can add Reviewed-by. I will make sure for
the last two patches especially to attribute those to you and if
possible keep you as the main author / not add myself if they require
no changes.

I do not have access to my Claw until the middle of August. Once I
have access to it I will have a closer look.
