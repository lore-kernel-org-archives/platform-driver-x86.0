OK, rather than whitelisting specific GUIDs to be exported, what if we matched
on a vendor and exported all of them except for the ones that any kernel drivers
have already bound to? For example, dell-wmi currently binds to:

#define DELL_EVENT_GUID "9DBB5994-A997-11DA-B012-B622A1EF5492"
#define DELL_DESCRIPTOR_GUID "8D9DDCBC-A997-11DA-B012-B622A1EF5492"

Perhaps a set of mof and $vendor-mof drivers could be created which would do what
Andy L's patch does, but match on DMI Vendor or WMI PNP UID and export all
interfaces. When another kernel driver binds to a WMI GUID, that GUID will
either not be exported, or it will be "locked" from a userspace perspective.

This of course is dependent on whether or not the WMI GUIDs are granular enough
or if the same GUID is needed by the userpsace application AND by the kernel
driver to perform different functions - this would be really unfortunate.

That said, from what I've learned about WMI, it was designed to provide access
to firmware from userspace. The approach we take in Linux currently was
expedient, but not consistent with the intent of the mechanism.
