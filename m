I don't have much of an opinion on changing the names,
to me open/close have always means start/stop receiving
events. This follows the everything is a file philosophy,
e.g. you can also not really "open" a serial port,
yet opening /dev/ttyS0 will activate the receive IRQ
of the UART, etc. So maybe we just need to make the
docs clearer rather then do the rename?  Doing the
rename is certainly going to cause a lot of churn.

Anyways as said, I don't have much of an opinion,
so I'll leave commenting (more) on this to Dmitry.

Right. I'm happy that you've come to see that both on open/close
and on inhibit/uninhibit we want to "start receiving events" and
"stop receiving events", so that we only need one set of callbacks.

Ack.
