I just went back and tried this specifically again to verify my memory
is correct. Without toshiba_acpi loaded, I see nothing. With it loaded
(with this patch series applied, which turns out to be important) I do
see the interrupt count increase. Further investigation leads me to
conclude that this activity appears to be associated with execution of
the INFO method -- reading and writing a variable in the EC address
space.
