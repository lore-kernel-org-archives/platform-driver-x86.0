I guess we should follow documentation. Or update documentation if it
does not make sense to follow it.

"::mute" is not a good idea due to name uniqueness.

In case you would have two drivers which both provides "mute" led, then
they need to have different name. Reason also why generic name "sys" is
not a good idea.

input subsystem seems to solved this problem by appending number after
"input" word.

I think that driver name or subsystem name would be usable together with
number.

Userspace application would be probably interested to distinguish
between "mute led which is part of laptop" and "mute led which is
available on external USB keyboard".

If external USB keyboard is identified as "input7" device, then
"input7::mute" is a good name for mute key. But "sys::mute" does not say
anything to which device or hardware it belongs nor does not solve
problem that which device/driver/subsystem should have privilege to take
this "sys" name.
