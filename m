Yep, I'm pretty sure this is the case, but I've not yet found a
command using more than 8 bits. Anyway the 16 bit code works
flawlessly here since we were already using "writew(command, ...);"
since the beginning.

Regarding the bits order, the driver depends on X86, so I don't see
this as a real issue.

That's how it seems to work, but I didn't see any command using more
that 24 bits yet.
