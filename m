Hmmm...  It's tricky in that debugfs doesn't have any of its own structures,
but is entirely built on standard VFS ones, so finding somewhere to store the
information is going to be awkward.  One obvious solution is to entirely lock
down debugfs in secure boot more, but that might be a bit drastic.

Note that it's still going to be a driver burden to some extent anyway.  The
driver has to tell the core what needs to be restricted.

Further, I guess configfs needs attention also.
