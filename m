But we are not adding such a fake trigger. We are only setting up the
kbd-backlight trigger on systems where there actually is hw-control.

Sure someone can do echo "kbd-backlight" > trigger to enable it,
but the same is true for e.g. "mtd" or "nand-disk" on systems
without an mtd-device / a nand-disk, and the result is the same,
the LED gets coupled to the trigger, but nothing ever triggers
the trigger.

I really believe that we have the right design now (I was skeptical
about the trigger approach at first, but it has turned out really
well) and unless Pavel Machek has any objections I would really like
patches 1-2 of this series merged.

Regards,

Hans


p.s.

Pali, I'm sorry that you don't like the LED side design, but there
has been a long discussion about this (which you apparently missed)
and this really is the best way forward.

Have you looked at what the new design means for the platform/x86
patches ? Gone is the ugly dell_laptop_notifier as the event
forwarding between dell-wmi and dell-laptop is now handles by
the led-trigger subsys.
