Well, no, the generic problem is not specific to this patch, but we can
avoid the issue with proper use of 'select' (at least in some cases),
which is specific to this patch.

If I'm not mistaken, if CONFIG_FOO is 'm', and it 'select's CONFIG_BAR,
and CONFIG_BAR is tristate, then CONFIG_BAR will be set to 'm'.

Why would you want to enable it if no one uses it? Does
BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE enable something even if no driver uses it?

If backlight support is considered an option for drm/i915, then I think
there should be a Kconfig option for i915 to enable backlight support,
which in turn selects BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE. And that select will force
BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE to be built-in if drm/i915 is built-in.

Oh, but it doesn't work optimally with modules. The new option needed
for that would be boolean, so BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE would always be
either y or n. Sigh...

If ACPI_VIDEO uses select to enable BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE, then, I
think, selecting ACPI_VIDEO will also select BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE. So
I don't right away see any recursive dependencies. Or what did you have
in mind?

Well, dri/i915 doesn't exactly depend on backlight, if I understood you
correctly. Instead, backlight is an option for dri/i915, and you kind of
hack it to be implemented with that 'depends on BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE
|| BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE=3Dn'.

I guess it's debatable whether drivers should automatically use features
in the kernel if they happen to be enabled in the Kconfig, or should
they be individually enabled for that driver. I personally like the
latter option, as it allows more precise control, but it probably also
depends on the feature in question.

I also think the 'depends on BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE ||
BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE=3Dn' pattern is quite... interesting (i.e. sounds
like a hack to me =3D).
