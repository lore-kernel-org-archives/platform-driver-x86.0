Thanks a lot for the helping hand. I will try your suggestion tonight 
and report back.

But please allow me to point out that I have doubts that HID or input is 
at fault, because when sniffing on the USB bus with usbmon, I do *not* 
see any information transported when pressing the middle button. 
Therefore, I would suspect it is rather the base USB driver that somehow 
needs a quirk to access the mouse properly.

Thanks a lot
Stephan
