Yes, a change done through hardware (through the firmware handled
hotkeys) will make the desktop environment show an osd overlay
with the new kbd backlight brightness, where as a change done
through e.g. the brightness slider in gnome-control-panel should
not show that same osd.

That is only part of it, we also want the OSD but ONLY when changed
through the hotkeys (on other models the hotkeys are handled in
userspace software, which will then also show the OSD, we want this
to be consistent whether the keys are handled in firmware or in
userspace).

A race condition which will always exists if userspace polls the backlight
periodically say once a minute then it can always end up polling just
before the hotkey press is done. Which is exactly why we need the event,
so we don't need to poll  and when the event is delivered we know the new
backlight level.
