Thanks for your report. I have a S10-3 but barely touch the wifi switch.

I know there are two drivers for Broadcom wifi chips. One is b43 which
is fully open and in linux kernel tree. The other is wl comes from
Broadcom with other license agreement and its source code is not fully
open.

I read the wl code and looks like they do not have fully support for
hardware switch. At least I think the driver shall update hw state when
initial.

I heard from my colleague who has and uses an ideapad s12. He told me
that with b43 driver never messes up the hardware switch state but
sometimes it sees APs but can not connect until reboot. The wl driver
sometimes reports wrong hardware switch state but can connect to AP if
'rfkill list' shows fine.

In your mail you did not mention the output of 'rfkill list'. In my
view point this is necessary info that tells us who block the wifi.
I guess the your wifi problem is because one of the wlan rfkill shows
blocked.

In this case I will suggest to use b43 driver which on Ubuntu you need
to disable wl driver (from jockey) and install firmware-b43-installer
package.

What I know is that the fix you suggest is hardly to be accepted
because those ACPI objects is not under VPC2004 and not always available
on ideapads. I have 8 ideapad DSDT but only two with those objects.

I will test the wifi switch on my ideapads again after I back to home
which will be next week and see if I can reproduce the same issue.
