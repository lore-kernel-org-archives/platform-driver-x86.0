I think it should be OK.
We currently will create a thermal cooling device for the ACPI backlight
device, its intention is that we can achieve some thermal purpose by
increasing or decreasing the backlight level(using the same set of
methods as the ACPI backlight one, though I'm not sure if it is being
used by anyone). When we are going to unregister the ACPI video
backlight interface, it most likely means that the interface doesn't
work so it doesn't make much sense to keep that thermal interface and
hence the thermal_cooling_device_unregister ends up being called here.
