They are. As I said I forgot about the inner workings and that check for
state != shutdown confused me even more, as it just looked like this might
be a valid state.

So if I understand correctly, this is the last resort of catching problems
which can't be detected upfront or are caused by a software bug.

I'm fine with that, but please explain and document it proper. The current
explanation is confusing at best.
