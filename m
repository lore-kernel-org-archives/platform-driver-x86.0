Thanks for pointers.  Its sometimes difficult to know were to ask for
help.  I found two bugzilla reports that are related:

Mentions exact bug that I'm seeing but doesn't document the
acpi_backlight=3Dvendor work around.  I've added my information to it:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D15182

Similar issue reported by an HP Mini and a 1005P user:

Does the acpi-video logic not have logic on its own to send key
events?  So I guess laptops that don't have custom modules to handle
this type of stuff don't get visual feedback from gnome-power-manager?

The visual indication is very nice to have although its a "feature"
that today the event isn't making it to gnome-power-manager.  If it
got involved, it would probably write to the /sys/* interfaces and I'd
get the non-linear brightness changes even for Fn-* changes.  If ACPI
video driver can be fixed to stop non-linear part then I'd like to
have the events somehow.

If you guys think letting key event go threw is correct behavior then
I may be able to provide a patch to eeepc-laptop for this.
