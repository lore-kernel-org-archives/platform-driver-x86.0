After a closer look, it seems as though some of it could be converted
into an MFD driver, but my prediction is that it's going to require
almost a complete re-write and we're going to need to re-work it over
several submissions.

The first thing you need to do is convert all of the hand rolled
platform device registration over to the MFD API.

The rest of the code is a mess.  It's over-complicated and mostly
unreadable.  What is it that you're trying to achieve?  What does the
device do and how does it function?  Do you have a datasheet that
you're working from?
