Ok, so userspace application wants to distinguish between these types of
events:

1) autonomous hardware decided to change brightness
2) application itself changed brightness
3) other application changed brightness
4) pressed keyboard hotkey changed brightness
  4.1) managed by firmware
  4.2) managed by some application

And for 4) and 1) you want to show notification to user, right?

So instead userspace polling you will ask for backlight level after
receiving firmware event. This is same race as in userspace. Returned
backlight level does not have to be one which caused firmware event. If
firmware delays that event (and due to ACPI slowness it can be really
delayed) then another backlight change could happen... And you will just
use incorrect level for comparison.

Basically on Dell machine you cannot distinguish between events done by
1), 2), 3) and 4). You are trying to hide this fact by bringing some
logic which on first look can fix it...

Also calling another SMBIOS call via SMM for every received event (even
if userspace is not interested in it) does not look like good
implementation. And another one is issued after userspace receive that
event (via poll()) and try to know current value.
