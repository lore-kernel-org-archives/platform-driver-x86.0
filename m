As far as I can tell, no. The Pro 4 and Pro 3 don't have any GPIOs on
MSHW0028/MSHW0040. Book 1 has GPIOs but for a different purpose. The Pro
2 has a standard PNP0C0C power button (no idea how the volume buttons
are handled there, but also seems to be different from what I can gather
from DSDT). I can't say anything for the Pro 1 and non-Pro devices.
