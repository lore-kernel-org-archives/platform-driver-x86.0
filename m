The alternative is for apple_bl to export its unregister function and 
have gmux call that - downside is obviously that that results in gmux 
depending on apple_bl. Maybe some sort of notification list in the 
backlight core?

The ACPI code appears to be trapping into system management mode, so 
figuring out what it's meant to do is going to be awkward. I think 
having a hook in the ACPI video driver to deregister it in cases where 
we know it doesn't work is legitimate, but since it presumably works 
under Windows it'd be nice to figure out what's broken about it.
