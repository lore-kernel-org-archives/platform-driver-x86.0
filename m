Are hrtimers not suspended after timekeeping_suspend is called?

It's not always something that can be checked by software. There was
one case where an ordering for powering down audio hardware prevented
proper PC10 entry, but there didn't seem to be any way to check that.
Hardware watchdogs also have the same lack of clarity, but most if not
all desktop and mobile processors ship with one. Overall, this seems
to be the best that can be done at this point in freeze, and we can't
really rely on every part of the system properly validating it's state
in its suspend operation.
