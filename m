Exporting the EC handle is static, you do not want to export all
kind of ACPI devices as soon as other drivers need them.

The question is how long it takes to do:
acpi_ns_walk_namespace(ACPI_TYPE_DEVICE, ...
in worst case (not found).

Ok, the EC may be somewhat special because it's the most likely
candidate to get shared (or say needed by other drivers)
and its driver has to be compiled in.
.
thinkpad_acpi should at least also make use of Seth's approach and get the
ec_handle quickly/directly.

And my patches should still be added, because others could use
them as well. Beside thinkpad_acpi grabbing the video handle, there
is another re-implementation of my acpi_handle_locate (eeepc_wmi.c):
static acpi_status eeepc_wmi_parse_device(acpi_handle handle, u32 level,
                                                 void *context, void **retval)
{
        pr_warn("Found legacy ATKD device (%s)\n", EEEPC_ACPI_HID);
        *(bool *)context = true;
        return AE_CTRL_TERMINATE;
}

static int eeepc_wmi_check_atkd(void)
{
        acpi_status status;
        bool found = false;

        status = acpi_get_devices(EEEPC_ACPI_HID, eeepc_wmi_parse_device,
                                  &found, NULL);

        if (ACPI_FAILURE(status) || !found)
                return 0;
        return -1;                                                                                                                                                    
}


If you agree I can send something tomorrow.
