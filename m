BIOS fires notifications in a constant period with VPC bit 1 set when the
power cord is unplugged.

This event is not known yet to have any effect, but it makes the
call to sparse_keymap_report_event() and generates many KEY_UNKNOWNs.

This causes the userspace (Gnome Power Manager in my case) unable
to enter the idle mode. As the result there is no screensaver showing up,
no dim backlight, etc.
