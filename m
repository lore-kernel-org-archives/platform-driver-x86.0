You are creating new sysfs files, yet you forgot to document them in
Documentation/ABI, please do so as part of this patch.

You really want to track the FSF's address for the next 40 years and
keep your file up to date?  I didn't think so...

WTF?

Oh, that's a sure sign you are not doing something properly, if you
think it's ok to muck around with the internals of sysfs.

There's a reason that file is "private", why do you think it's ok to use
it directly?  Did you just think that I somehow "forgot" to put it in
the proper include directory?

Kids these days...

Surely one of the internal Intel code reviews caught this when you ran
it through that process?

I'm not even going to review the rest of this file, please fix that up
first, before sending it out again.  And, when you do so, please cc: me.

Oh, I couldn't help myself:

No, that's not how you do a release function (hint, you can lock up your
driver from userspace by holding your file open...)  Free the memory
here, where it is supposed to be free.

And, one final complaint, never use "raw" kobjects, for loads of good
reasons, not the least being you just prevented userspace from seeing
what is happening with your devices.  Use the driver model, that's what
it is there for, if you need "sub children", or subdirectories.
