This highlights the fact that this patch-set is not actually
bisectable.  To say that, when bisecting if we landed somewhere in the
middle of this set, we would receive build errors.

Ergo, this set is not actually acceptable in its current state.
Please squash all patches where you are a) changing the API (in the
MFD header), then b) transitioning users (child devices) over to it.

Ensure that you do not make any code changes and remember to move all
of the Acks you collected into the squashed patch.  Also, please use
the $SUBJECT lines commonly used by particular subsystems.  For MFD
the format is thus:

  mfd: <device>: Patch description starting with an uppercase character
