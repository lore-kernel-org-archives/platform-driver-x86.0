=46irst application which controls leds is integrated into desktop=20
environment. In basic/default settings it do nothing automatically, just=20
show GUI bar to user and allow user to adjust LED level.

Second one is basic shell script executed at specific situation (e.g.=20
power adapter was unplugged) which changes LED level.

Now you have two independent applications which both could change LED=20
level and at least one of them needs to know if another one changed=20
level so can adjust GUI bar correctly.

I think this starts to be real situation for lot of users as more=20
desktops (gnome, kde, ...) have already GUI bars for setting keyboard=20
backlight and more users writes own scripts which at specific=20
time/condition call echo > brightness.

Yes, if somebody uses GUI bar for manual keyboard backlight probably=20
does not use led trigger or blinking feature. Probably that GUI desktop=20
application could turn off them (do not know if kde/gnome application=20
really turn off them).

Above situation for setting manual level of led is normal. And in this=20
situation setting trigger or blink support does not make sense.=20
Specially when user want to manually set led level.

I think it is good idea to provide some poll-able sysfs for this change.=20
And if brightness is used for writing, then I would expect that=20
brightness also provide poll() state.

Yes, it could be little confusing due to triggers/blinking support, but=20
I think it is better as providing new sysfs file and it does not make=20
this interface worse...

That would need to force all application to decide on this specific=20
path. And looks bad as kernel already provides brightness attribute, why=20
it should not also notify for changes on it?

Why it should be running daemon? Script which you start when you want=20
change is also enough... no need to have permanently running process.
