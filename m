So... When calling WMI method of some class it is really needed to
supply also instance id. On Windows caller needs to specify Instance
Name, e.g. ACPI\PNP0C14\0_0 which looks like correspondent to instance
id 0. ACPI\PNP0C14\0_2 is then to instance id 2.

Toshiba has triple (class, method, instance) in their BIOS WMI
documentation [1].

Therefore userspace would need to know instance count which is stored in
_WDG for doing WMI call.

Is there already exported instance count via sysfs?
