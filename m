I didn't see a good mechanism that was provided by Acer or MSI BIOS to
set the wifi key behavior like you said in Asus BIOS.
Their EC just control the RF switch follow a default priority, like:
	wlan on, bt on, 3G on
	wlan on, bt off, 3G off
	...
	wlan off, bt off, 3G off

The logic is not fully the same with different hardware model.
And,=20
As I know, on Windows, they sometimes also disable the default behavior
because they have something like hotkey manager or launch manager to
handle it.

I thought just direct disable the default EC behavior then leave a
userland daemon to control the behavior, it will grab the wifi key even=
t
then control rfkill state by follow user's customization rules.


Thank's
