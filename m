The feature is a description of the hardware capability not of the
way how it's used by software.

Ok. I completely forgot about the inner workings of freeze. So this check
for shutdown actually wants to have a printk, because that's a state which
is wrong. The nonavailability of oneshot mode is just factual information
that this is not possible and does not justify dmesg spam.

Fair enough.

Yes, you want to store that information somewhere.

Please make that whole thing depend on a Kconfig option. There is no point
having the code and the exports there for everyone while it has only a
single user.
