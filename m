Yeah, SMAPI is the safest way to deal with all this.  It is an interface
layer that Lenovo is not fond of breaking (or touches very rarely.  Amounts
to the same in the end).

SBS does not take care of thresholds, indeed.  The EC does (and I know how
to program the threshold in a few models, if you do want to test it in your
X220, I can send you the information.  It is safe to test if you use it
together with SMAPI to cross-check).

The SBS ACPI interface would be useful to provide a single driver that can
replace the ACPI battery one to deliver full functionality in one place.
