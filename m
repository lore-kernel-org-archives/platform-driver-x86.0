FWIW I'd love to consider patches to address this, if this is something
you may find a need for in the future to *avoid* the fallback, however
would like a clean solution.

I've given this some more thought and you can address this with initramfs,
this is how other Linux distributions are addressing this. One way to
address this automatically is to scrape the drivers built-in or needed early on
boot in initamfs and if the driver has a MODULE_FIRMWARE() its respective
firmware is added to initramfs as well.

If you *don't* use initramfs, then yes you can obviously run into issues
where your firmware may not be accessible if the driver is somehow loaded
early.

Using initramfs will help, but because of the custom path needs -- you're
right, we don't have anything for that yet, its also a bit unclear if
something nice and clean can be drawn up for it. So perhaps dealing with
the fallback mechanism is the way to go for this for sure, since we already
have support for it.

Just keep in mind that the fallback mechanism costs you about ~13436 bytes.

So, if someone comes up with a clean interface for custom paths I'd love
to consider it to avoid those 13436 bytes.
