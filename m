So first, I'm not opposed to adding it if that's what needed. However, I don't
want to start pushing ACPI objects to sysfs without:

1) Confirming it's necessary
2) Getting Rafael's take on this practice, as if this is to become something we
do, some kind of ACPI_OBJECT_SYSFS_EXPORT macro provided by ACPI would probably
be the right way to do it.

My understanding of the BMOF data is that it provided us "with a description of
all data blocks, WMI methods, and events for the device" [1].

If that's accurate, why do we need the _WDG? This just seems contrary to what
the BMOF data is supposed to be for.

For debugging purposes, the fwts and acpidump tools will provide this.

In this case, I'd argue userspace should only be aware of what the kernel
decides to expose, based on, at the very least, compliance with the WMI
documentation.
