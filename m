Unfortunately, the results are, again, rather confusing. With
sony-laptop.ko, after running backlight_fix once, actual_brightness has
a nonsensical value -- 55. I tried setting it to 5, and something
actually happens this time - actual_brightness now reads 5 rather than
-1, and the screen brightness actually changes -- but, alas, too much
(if the brightness range is from 0 to 7, 5 should be rather bright,
instead it looked more like a 2 to me).

Further attempts to adjust brightness produced no result --
actual_brightness now tallies with brightness, like the video.ko's
behavior, but the screen remained dim. Repeatedly running backlight_fix
does not resolve matter either.

With the video.ko driver, backlight_fix appears to have no effect.

Anything else I can try? I've not tried Rui's solution yet, as I haven't
found a kernel tree where the patches would apply *and* build cleanly yet.

Thanks,
