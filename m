It means that both values are 0 (default). The first one is wrongly
mapped to 100, but should probably be reported as 0.

Also, the values are not mangled correctly when writing: 100
as a stop threshold should be written as 0, and and 100 as a
start threshold should be illegal, giving you:

	start = [0, 99]
	stop = [1, 100]

Which is what my patch series a few years ago implemented. I
never got to integrate that with the acpi battery driver, though.
