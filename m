Press Fn key and don't release will switch Adaptive Keyboard to Functio=
n
mode whatever current mode is. And release Fn key will restore it to ol=
d
mode including Function mode. So current logic should not confuse end
user here. :)

LAYFLAT_MODE can be triged by putting screen to flat only, not by Fn
key. Maybe list LAYFLAT_MODE with other modes will confuse others and
make program need special logic to switch mode. I'm thinking over this
too. Since unsupported modes still not clear, I wish following patch ca=
n
handle them good.

DRF_CHANGE_ROW event in FUNCTION_MODE should always change keyboard to
Home mode.

On Windows, DFR_CHANGE_ROW will switch keyboard among four modes. On
Linux, currently switch between Home mode and Function mode. Since not
all Windows function can be mapped to Linux like Web conference, so
Linux user don't expect those modes appear too. I think it makes sense
too. :)
