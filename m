Thanks.

I thought all samsung laptops had SABI, but as the other samsung laptop
driver shows, that's not true.

I don't know what happens if we try to check for SABI on those machines.
We are just rooting around in the BIOS rom and reading values,
_hopefully_ that wouldn't break any other machines, but I don't really
know.

I wouldn't mind just doing a DMI match on all Samsung laptops, it would
save me having to constantly send patch updates, so I'll let this be
your call :)

thanks,
