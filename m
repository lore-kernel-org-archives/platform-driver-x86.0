On this system if you don't futz with the firmware in just the right
way it hides the Intel GPU:

https://github.com/marineam/linux/commit/1f2fcbbca18176e2e6c862774428da=
d878bbac51

Exposing the Intel GPU isn't particularly great because power
management gets wonky and I've never figured out how to switch between
the GPUs, reconfiguring the eDP link never works right. Even when
running with the Intel hidden the current nouveau driver cannot redo
the eDP link so I have a hack to prevent modesetting from ever
powering the link down:

https://github.com/marineam/linux/commit/4b7e27ba268755963e24886e26e198=
531aa4da68

In short this machine is frickin weird.

I had assumed that the Intel GPU was completely out of the game when
hidden but if that isn't the case this sounds complicated. :(
