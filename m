After traced the acpidump of HP EliteBook 8560w from you,=20
I added Cc. to you on this mailing loop because your HP EliteBook 8560w
has the same situation with HP EliteBook 8460p.

Pali Roh=C3=A1r reported the same brightness control issue on 8460p.

The only difference between 8560w with 8460p is HP's ODM put _BCM and
SBRV in SSDT3 table on 8560w.

Please kindly read the above my description. Sorry for I don't have any
solution, now.


Thanks a lot!
Joey Lee
