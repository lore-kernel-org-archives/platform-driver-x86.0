I have some ideas, and I want your confirmation if that would be
acceptable.

Can I do this:

Expose a new API from battery.c for platform specific hooks:

struct battery_hook {
	int (*add_battery)(struct acpi_battery* battery);
	int (*remove_battery)(struct acpi_battery *battery);
};

battery_hook_register(struct battery_hook *hook)
battery_hook_unregister(struct battery_hook *hook)

When that hook is invoked from some other module, battery.c 
calls the add_battery method for each battery that is added and
remove_battery for each battery that is removed.

battery.c would keep a list of the battery_hook structs and invoke 
the add_battery and remove_battery methods as batteries get added 
and removed. 

With this API, we can add more hooks for battery features in 
the future, not just the ThinkPad hooks.

I hope you like the proposal :)
