Hmm, that's weird.

The cherryview pinctrl driver does not (yet) support wake up events. It
currently just sets IRQCHIP_SKIP_SET_WAKE for the irqchip.

Source for this information is coming from an internal documentation for
the SoC. For some reason it is not included in the datasheet.

IntSel field is RO and filled in by the BIOS. The mapping from IntSel
and I/O-APIC pins seems also missing from the datasheet but for example
for north community, IntSel 0-7 maps to I/O-APIC pins 51-58 (and OR of
those is 48).

The GPIOs under GPIO controller are generally used for either ACPI GPIO
events or GPIO Operation Region. Those are used by the AML code to
access the GPIO hardware with the help of OS.

The INT33F5 PMIC from your DSDT table seems to have one GpioInt()
resource which it uses as an interrupt. This is handled already by the
I2C core. In order to use that PMIC you need a driver and I'm not sure
if there is one for that particular part.

Or it may be handled by the embedded controller itself. The FADT ACPI
table should tell you if it has "fixed power button" or is it using some
other mechanism (like control method power button).

Because it is "virtual" and does not expose any hardware. The
pinctrl-cherryview deals only with the GPIO block found on
Braswell/Cherryview.

IIRC that virtual GPIO thing was used to fix USB device wakeup or
something like that.

I can make you a test patch which adds support for wakes for the pinctrl
driver if you like to test it out. However, that will happen most likely
near end of the week as I have other things right now.

Right, a driver is needed. There are bunch of custom OpRegion handlers
under drivers/acpi/pmic/*.
