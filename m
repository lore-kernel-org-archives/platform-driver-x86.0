Right. But from ACPI prospective the proposed change is not okay by my opin=
ion.

How can I see what drivers are binding / relying on certain ACPI ID?

More precisely,

% git grep -n -w SMO8800

would be useless until one gets an idea to match against partial strings.

In case of dell-smo8800.c the driver actually *binds* to these IDs.
Your change just provide another table to match and answer to the
question if XYZ is present on a such platform or not.

Similar approach is used in spi-pxa2xx.c (check pxa2xx_spi_pci_compound_mat=
ch).
