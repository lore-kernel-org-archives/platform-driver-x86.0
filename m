If I understand correctly, vga_switcheroo manages two GPUs that have a
single output: either there's a mux that connects one GPU or the other
to the output, or one GPU is permanently connected to the output and
the other does offline rendering.

To this non-GPU person, it sounds like the important question is
whether two GPUs are related in this way (either they feed the same
mux, or there's some special offline rendering connection between
them).  That sounds unrelated to the question of how the GPUs
themselves are connected to the PCI hierarchy.

From a pure PCI perspective, I assume it would be conceivable to have
two Thunderbolt-connected GPUs feeding into a mux.  Or to have a GPU
(unrelated to the mux) in a non-Thunderbolt plugin slot or connected
externally via a non-Thunderbolt switch and an iPass cable.

If that's the case, and we're using Thunderbolt-connectedness as a
hint that happens to work for the hardware we know about now, that's
fine -- I'm just trying to understand what's a hint and what's
intrisic to being connected via Thunderbolt.

I'm not really keen on having this in the PCI core because the core
doesn't need this or even know what it means.

pci_find_next_ext_capability() is available to drivers, and if
Thunderbolt-connectedness is useful information to apple-gmux or GPU
drivers, it's fine with me if you want to use it there.  I just don't
see the benefit to having it in the core.

The comment suggests this returns false only if @pdev is soldered to
the mainboard.  I don't think that's the case.  This will return true
for a Thunderbolt controller and all devices downstream from it.  It
will return false for all others, whether they're soldered down or
not.
