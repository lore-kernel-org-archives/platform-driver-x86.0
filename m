Actually sometimes we'll get negative feedback for anything we do. I
still believe exposing the backlight case as a trigger is a right thing.

Yes, that could be done. I'd not call it persistent trigger, but
with right name...

#1:

Apparently some LEDs change themselves, and we can't find how or
when. That's thinkpad battery LED, for example.

#2:

Then there are some LEDs that change themselves, and we can get
notifications. We should make it very clear that we'll not send
notifications kernel did itself.

So... for #1 and #2 something like

led/hardware_changes_brightness=20

and for #2

led/poll_for_hardware_brightness_change

where poll() wakes the userspace up when the brightness changes, and
read() can get new brightness...?
