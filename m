No, that wouldn't be good here. In effect that means that with INPUT disabled,
most of the x86 platform drivers are disabled, until you enable the
PCENGINES_APU2 symbol, which then ends up showing all the other
symbols at once, and changing them to their default states.

Another problem is that you likely run into circular dependency chains
after trying that. The best practice for select vs. depends are

1. try to use 'depends on' if you can
2. use 'select' on hidden symbols, but not user visible ones
3. for each symbol, use either 'depends on'  or 'select' from all other
    drivers that need it, and do it consistently
4. never select entire subsystems, only helper code.

Those are sometimes at odds. I used 'select' for the LEDS code
because of 3. and 4, even though that goes against 2. For INPUT,
there is no real debate though.
