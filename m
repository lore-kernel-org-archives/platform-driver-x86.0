This is only a problem with crazy PC's which have multiple firmware
API's (both standardized and custom ACPI) to control the backlight, which
also are sometimes all broken. So this really is an acpi thing, and I believe
this should stay in acpi/video_detect.c where it already lives, I just think
the video.use_native_backlight option which clearly interacts with this needs
to be moved to acpi/video_detect.c too.

The problem with this is that it causes module load ordering issues where
we get the acpi_video# device registered first, then a vendor specific
custom acpi backlight driver (ie thinkpad_acpi) loads and unregisters it
again. This is ugly and on some models makes the firmware unhappy
(we currently have quirks for these models to work around this).

But I've recently learned that since for determining which firmware method to
load / expose we need to know if the video driver will register a raw backlight
interface or not, which introduces similar issues. So there is no way to
avoid these ordering issues, so I agree that it is best to keep the quirks
in the vendor specific acpi extension drivers where possible.

Not sure if you're referring to the above discussion here, or to my remark
about hotkey issues, so let me answer both:

* As for why we cannot simply register all firmware backlight drivers
and let userspace figure things out. There are 2 reasons:
1) Userspace will pick the first firmware driver it sees, to avoid this
causing issues we've historically always registered only one. So we're
stuck with this approach to avoid causing regressions
2) Having multiple pieces of firmware code frob the same hardware seems
like a really really bad idea.

* As for the hotkeys issue, the problem is actually very much the same as
with the backlight control. laptop brightness hotkeys tend to generate 3
events for each press:
1) A ps2 atkbd scancode
2) an acpi-video event
3) a vendor-wmi event.

1) may be mapped to generate input events through /lib/udev/hwdb.d/60-keyboard.hwdb
2) will generate input events if the acpi-video driver is registered
   (independent of it also exporting a backlight control interface)
3) may or may not generate events depending on the vendor specific driver

I know of at least one laptop where all 3 methods are hooked up, causing
the brightness to go down 3 levels for each keypress. This is something else
wrt backlight control which we clearly need to fix, to ensure that we only
send one input event per key press.

Hmm, that sounds like something which is going to turn very ugly very soon.
Have tried using acpi_backlight=vendor, so that the acpi-video driver will
only catch events and not try to do any backlight control? Then the
vaio driver can register its own backlight device, and userspace gets the
event from the acpi-video driver, and can change the brightness accordingly
using the vaio driver backlight device.

Or are you trying to make the buttons work without a userspace component
being involved? Please forget about that, that ship has sailed a long time
ago. acpi-video used to that, but it actually causes more issues then it
fixes, and it is inconsistent with how things work on many other laptops.

Userspace simply does not deal with this at all, it will still respond to
the keypresses anyways, and you get the backlight level changing multiple
steps at once for each keypress.

Anyways I really think you need to find a different solution for this,
simply have the one part which you now want to do the signalling only
generate input events, and have the part with the working backlight control
be the only one to register a firmware backlight device.

Hans
