Sorry I was too busy to work on v2 before seeing this. I agree I need
to simplify the interface, I just need to come up with a more
intelligent way to abstract that and do the best guesses for the user.
Hopefully, v2 will serve as a confirmation on the comments I got from
v1. i.e. kobject->struct device, removed dependencies on sysfs internal
data struct, etc.

existing interface has only cur_state and max_state, I have been
working with Rui (thermal maintainer) on adding more knobs for cooling
devices, such as limit low, limit high, event control. I believe they
can all be added.

What is not appropriate for thermal interface are the things like
energy counters, accumulated throttle time, time constants that used by
the internal control algorithm.

I agree we should improve the abstraction to avoid using device
specific attributes. Unfortunately, on the other side power tuning tends
to be very platform specific.

Agreed. I just want to make sure the rapl class and per domain 'struct
device' layout in v2 is what you suggested. I avoided using raw kobjects
and sysfs internals.

The challenge for the simplified/abstract model is that the driver
would have to guess what is best for the user.
e.g. when user selects power limit of 8200mw for the core power plane.
Besides setting that limit, the driver will decide the following for
the user:
 - dynamics of the control, rise time, overshoot, steady state error
 - whether or not allow P/T states to go below OS request value
 - correlation with instantaneous power limit

I believe it is all doable, just need to strike a balance and for
different platforms. But I do believe it is a better interface for most
generic applications.
