Bug 86521 uncovered that some TOS6208 devices also return
non zero values on a write call to the backlight method,
thus getting caught and bailed out by the extra check code.

This patch makes sure that the extra check is being done
on a TOS1900 device and then make the check for the broken
backlight code.
