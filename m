Yes, I am aware of that. I just wanted to get feedback and validate
the new platform driver that makes use of this new RFKill LED trigger
before proposing it, since I expect that will be their first
questioning.

=46or those who were not in the original message, this is patch is part
of a series implementing a new platform driver for the airplane mode
hotkey and LED present in some Asus laptops, which is a separate ACPI
device (not part of WMI) with ACPI _HID "ASHS" and named "Wireless
Radio Control" by Asus.

Thanks for your feedback!
