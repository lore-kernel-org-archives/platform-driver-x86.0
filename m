Hi,

I hate to say it but my first reaction to this was, 'What are so
many functions doing in one file in the first place?'

The embedded world has been busy splitting up and reparcelling large
files like this so the various devices end up within the correct
subsystems. I won't even go into all the reasons for this as they
are listed everywhere else?  Is this just a case of modifying old
code no one wants to touch on a larger scale or is there actually
resistance to breaking new functionality out of this file and
into nice clean small chunks?
   
So my first request is can we at least split this new functionality
out?

As I look through what we have here, it looks like we ought to have
this functionality alone split into the ALS sensor and a backlight
driver (which can by all means use the standard interfaces to
talk to the ALS)... (event support for in kernel users isn't there
yet, but this might motivate us to hurry up with it).

The bulk of this driver is actually just a set of nasty access routines
and then functionality that already exists in the existing tsl2563 driver.
Hence, unless there are very good reasons why not I would suggest the
following.

1) Convert the existing tsl2563 driver over to using regmap.
2) Add regmap support for the access routines we have here then add the
    little bit of code needed to make the tsl2563 register appopriately.  This
    may require a small amount of magic mfd like code in here.
(plan b on this is to perhaps create an i2c bus driver using the sony
specific calls).
3) Figure out what extra bits are that are needed by the ALS driver we have
    here and add them on (kelvin support and perhaps a few other bits).
4) Then and only then take on any non ALS elements in here (such as the
    back light).

The other als driver (one where all the clever stuff is hidden) should ideally
be a completely separate als driver (be it a very simple one.

Anyhow, your code is reasonably clean but I think some of these questions about
the fundamental approach need addressing to avoid getting ourselves into a
nasty mess in the long term.   Sorry if this review seems a little negative.
I appreciate that you've only taken the approach taken throughout this file!

Just as an aside, is there any interest in cleaning this whole file up?
The sonypi device looks like it should registering a whole host of standard
interfaces...

Is this a target value?  Need a better description for this as it's not immediately
obvious what it is.

If applied to the measurement before exposed to userspace then it should
be handled using the iio info_mask element calibscale. If it's a value that
should be applied in userspace then the scale infomask element.

Interesting.  These are a new one :)
Anyhow the should be handled through additions to iio's iio_event_info
enum and all the stuff that goes with that.
Perhaps
IIO_EV_INFO_PERCENT, with sysfs attributes
events/in_illuminance_thresh_rising_percent
events/in_illuminance_thresh_falling_percent

Actually you don't seem to have any IIO_EV_INFO stuff in here yet you
are still pushing out events via IIO. Interesting...

The naming is not nearly descriptive enough as I'd read that as being how
often an event (e.g. it going dark) is checked from the als.

These are so device dependent we'll probably just let them go.  Might be
something that's worth checking with the input guys to discover if they
have an interface already defined for this sort of thing.

Offset, or a scale factor?  Either way there are well defined abi elements for
this already.

Expected in what sense?

That's a lot of new abi as far as IIO is concerned.  It will all need documenting in
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-iio-sony-laptop or the generic files if appropriate.
Also, no units for some of the above.

An excellent question.   Ranges aren't currently well defined.
There is a patch set I posted a while ago introducing _available
type sysfs attributes which does include the ability to specify
the limits on any iio info_mask element (including *_input)
which would do the job.  That series has gotten somewhat stalled
by me being busy though... Hence I'm not totally against this
but it would be in_illuminance_maximum to fit with the normal
ABI form.  We'd just leave this in place once that new support
is there as well. Doesn't do any realy harm.

Why not just reorder the code so these show functions are
before they are used?  Looks straight forward and much neater.
I guess this is part of this being in a monolithic file.

The more I read, the more I think this definitely needs breaking
up.  Taking this driver outside of it is just the start.

This one isn't documented above.  Every attr MUST be documented.
It needs to be in the Documentation/ABI/testing directory, but
having it above would have been a good start ;)

Are we talking actual temperature or colour temperature here?

Whilst this stuff is presumably being driver from the ALS it is decidedly
back light specific. Perhaps I'm idealistic in thinking it should be
a different driver.

These are the same register defines as in the tsl2563 driver. Please factor
them out of there into a header then use it. We don't want this repeated in
two different drivers.

very similar stuff to this is in the tsl2563 driver.

I'm against limiting a driver to a single instance on principle

Hmm. So in this code you are talking directly the underling taos chip?
Interesting.  I wonder if it would be possible with the insertion
of a few callbacks to utilize som of the tsl2563 code directly..

Why _exec_  Also these are totaly sony specific as far as I can see.
Hence call it.
sony_tsl256x_write_byte or similar.

Why pass the value as a pointer?  If you are writing it that makes no real
sense.  Just pass a u16. Same for the writebyte above. Will get rid
of quite a few unnecessary lines of code below.

As you are reading a word, don't use a 32bit + integer.
u16 *result

Then you can avoid the masking below as well.

If none provided, do you need to set it at all? If you do then the comment
should make this clear.

Read the return values of the exec_writebyte and return that. I know
here it is the same, but it will leave use with a more obviously correct
driver which will be easier to maintain in the long run.

Here is a fine illustration of why passing a pointer into a write function
for the value is not a clean way of doing it.  Also, two possible errors
here that aren't handled.  Check for all such cases and make sure you have
handled them.

return directly
e.g.
if (status)
	return sony_tsl256x_write_byte(TSL2563_REG_CTRL, TSL256X_POWER_ON);
else
	return sony_tsl256x_write_byte(TSL2563_REG_CTRL, TSL256X_POWER_OFF);
Or even better reorganise the function to only check status once.

Cleaner not to bother with this function and just read the channels
directly where they are wanted via the readword calls.  It doesn't
add much to readability etc.

I'd like to know how this differs form the function in tsl2563.c...

This is new for a tsl256x chip..  Hmm. approximate temperature form the
infrared channel?  How accurate is it? (just currious as I wouldn't have
through these were really suitable for use as thermopiles)

Flip this and exit out wiht an error.  Thats a far more common

So down to here you have some sony specific read access to a device
we already have support for.... See introduction to this review.

Now this looks more interesting...

Again, you are pushing without there being any sysfs elements to control them..
With those missing there is no way for userspace to know that the device
might spit out events, or what they might be...

If so then then this is what should be controllable from userspace...
via the event_info elements in iio.
There are a lot of magic addresses in here. If they are known then
they should be replaced by appropriately informative #defined names.

Naming of this vs next function is confusing.. Call it
sony_nc_als_array_show or similar (or just name it after the backlight
and be done with it)

use a shift instead of *256 (usual thing about what people expect rather than
anything else. Might also need a typecast to avoid ti occuring entirely
in a u8 value (which obviously won't work).

I'd argue this is just a temperature reading and hence should be done
via a temperature channel. Irritatingly they are in celcius, but
the conversion is at least nice and easy ;)

Either drop the free or don't use a devm allocation.  You don't
want one in the probe error path either.
