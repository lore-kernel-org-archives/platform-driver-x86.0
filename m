Thanks a lot. I found it and it works.

All right, I did some more testing...

I was not able to reproduce this with Windows somewhere in the game -
neither via switching BT off in Windows and rebooting to Windows nor via
switching BT off in Linux and rebooting to Windows nor via switching BT
off in Windows and rebooting to Linux.

Yes, the cfgbit changes. It's normally 0xd0000 and it's 0xc0000 when the
bluetooth switch is not detected.

It's not that reproducible as it first appeared to be. Sometimes it does
not happen, i.e. sometimes after rfkill block 1 and reboot the
bluetooth killswitch is available again.

If the bluetooth killswitch is not available, a second reboot usually
makes it available again.

Once the cfgbit is 0xc0000 it's stable, i.e. modprobe -r ideapad-laptop;
modprobe ideapad-laptop doesn't change anything.

I tried to enforce the existence of the bluetooth killswitch (the
attached diff is not for inclusion but to show what I did) with some
kind of success:

[  682.260288] ideapad_acpi_add(): cfg=3D0xc0000
[  682.260293] ideapad_acpi_add(): found: ideapad_camera
[  682.260297] ideapad_acpi_add(): found: ideapad_wlan

lNumber=3D3
[  683.028244] usb 4-1: Product: BCM2046 Bluetooth Device

So, forcing the existence of the killswitch enables the bluetooth
device. I'm also able to switch if off again - the bluetooth device
disappears. Trying to switch it back on then fails - the bluetooth
device does not appear again. But this case doesn't work all that well
anyways even with cfgbit 0xd0000:

$ rfkill block 1

[  185.956033] usb 4-1: device descriptor read/64, error -110

Sometimes it doesn't even come back at all on unblock. Seems like the
bluetooth device doesn't really like to be powered off and on that way.
Btw.: once I messed up the bluetooth device that way not even Windows
sees it anymore when I reboot to it.

=46rom all this I'm inclined to assume it has more to do with the
bluetooth device's USB interface than with the killswitch handling
itself. I believe the S12 BIOS just probes the device(s) on it's own and
sets the cfgbit accordingly and sometimes it just doesn't find the
bluetooth device - why ever.

This all does btw. not happen when I use the hci0 killswitch instead.
The device doesn't disappear then, has no issues with re-initialization,
etc. Looks way more stable that way.
I'm not absolutely sure about the different implications of using the
one or the other killswitch - maybe using the ACPI killswitches saves
more power than using the device-specific killswitches because it powers
the device(s) down completely, but that's just a wild guess - maybe it's
absolutely wrong, though.
However, it would probably be worth thinking about not offering the
additional RF killswitches at all but just doing the initialization
stuff to make sure the devices power up and are thus able to be handled
via their own killswitches subsequently.

Please let me know if I can provide more testing - and what kind of :)
