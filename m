Up for review.

This series of patches are a cleanup to the Toshiba
configuration interface return codes (unification),
since we are now using both the HCI and the SCI, as
well as changing the returned type of the HCI/SCI
read/write functions from acpi_status to u32, since
the "status" was never checked on most of the functions.

Changes since v1:
- Be a bit more verbose on patch 1 about the Toshiba
  configuration interface
- Merged patches 3 and 4 into a same patch

Azael Avalos (3):
  toshiba_acpi: Rename hci_raw to tci_raw
  toshiba_acpi: Unify return codes prefix from HCI/SCI to TOS
  toshiba_acpi: Change HCI/SCI functions return code type
