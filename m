Come on, no blaming the BIOS? ;-)

If I read the code with your previous patch correctly, show_turbo_limits 
will never be called if poll_turbo_status is false but no interrupt 
happens. And we know no interrupt happened (at least not with nonzero 
register values), because the interrupt handler does two dev_info() 
right at the beginning. So the limits could still be the ones initially 
set at ips_probe().

I will try to enable dev_dbg() later and see what it prints.

Wouldn't it make more sense to do the alert when the limit is set, 
instead of when it is used? Also, it should still treat it as limit 
exceeded (better safe than sorry). Something like:

if (measured_val > limit) {
     if (limit)
         dev_info(...);
     ret = true;
}
