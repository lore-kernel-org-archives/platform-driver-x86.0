That's correct, but it should be sufficient to check the PC10 residency
(there's some code to do that in turbostat, for example).

Yes, there is.

PC10 is a power state of the north complex and it can be entered regardless
of the SLP_S0 status which is related to the south complex.

Fair enough, but even so it may not be very useful in general as is.

In the suspend-to-idle path the driver will always request the deepest state
available (C10 for Skylake) and I would validate the associated package state
by default plus optionally SLP_S0.

Yes, it can, but this is based on the hint and not on the entered state. :-)

There is some gray area related to what if the user disabled the deepest state
via sysfs, but other than that the check only needs to be made in the deepest
state's callback (because that's what will be requested in the suspend-to-idle
path).
