So we will need to fix that. Maybe we should make it configurable.
E.g. a sysfs file could define whether writing 0 to brightness file
clears a trigger.

Trigger can already be disabled by writing "none" to triggers file.

Having this type of hardware trigger reflected in the LED class
device configuration all the time is not something critical I think.
More important is leaving a possibility of applying other existing
sources of kernel events to the LED controller.
