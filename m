Ok, module blacklisting can be a problem.

Understood. Driver itself can also do more work, e.g. ask ACPI or do
some other check to decide whatever to register to vga_switcheroo or
not.

But probably, hda_intel should have same logic for disabling device like
gpu drivers for detection if they are going to register into
vga_switcheroo or not.

Right now this seems to be really complicated and suggested solution
with pci_is_thunderbolt_attached() looks to be really simple and better
for now.
