Well, it really depends if the "plaform::disk" is for all the disks,
or if it is for sda. In the second case, it might be better to name it
sda::disk...

Anyway... I believe we should start documenting good and bad LEDs, so
that patch authors know what is there, and can try to be consistent,
and so that userland knows what names to probe for.

What about following? Any other LEDs worth mentioning?

+It is somehow important to provide consistent interface to the
+userland. LED devices have one problem there, and that is naming of
+directories in /sys/class/leds. It would be nice if userland would
+just know right "name" for given LED function, but situation got more
+complex.
+
+Anyway, if backwards compatibility is not an issue, new code should
+use one of the "good" names from this list, and you should extend the
+list where applicable.
+
+Bad names are listed, too, in case you are writing application that
+wants to use particular feature, you should probe for good name first
+but then try the bad ones, too".
+
+* Keyboards
+
+Good: "input*:*:capslock"
+Good: "input*:*:scrolllock"
+Good: "input*:*:numlock"
+
+Set of common keyboard LEDs, going back to PC AT or so.
+
+Bad: "tpacpi::thinklight" (IBM/Lenovo Thinkpads)
+Bad: "lp5523:kb{1,2,3,4,5,6,7}" (Nokia N900)
+
+Keyboard frontlight/backlight.
+
+* Sound subsystem
+
+Good: "platform:*:mute"
+Good: "platform:*:micmute"
+
+LEDs on notebook body, indicating that sound input / output is muted.
+
+* System notification
+
+Good: "status-led:{red,green,blue}" (Motorola Droid 4)
+Bad: "lp5523:{r,g,b}" (Nokia N900)
+
+Phones usually have multi-color status LED.
