Are you looking for something in the changelog, the comment, or just
a response?  If it's the latter...

On bare metal with a bug-free kernel, the only scenario I'm aware of
where we'll encounter these faults is when hardware pulls the rug out
from under us.  In a virtualized environment all bets are off because
the architecture allows VMMs to silently "destroy" the EPC at will,
e.g. KVM, and I believe Hyper-V, will take advantage of this behavior
to support live migration.  Post migration, the destination system
will generate PF_SGX because the EPC{M} can't be migrated between
system, i.e. the destination EPCM sees all EPC pages as invalid.
