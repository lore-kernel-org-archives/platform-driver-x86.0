KEY_ROTATE_DISPLAY will resolve to XF86RotateWindows. This is a button
for devices without accelerometers (such as old Thinkpad tablet models
with Wacom builtin), to request the display to be rotated. It's not a
request to the OS to toggle the acceleration lock.

The acceleration lock is currently handled in user-space if "Win+O" is
pressed, as some BIOSes will generate this key combination directly,
which Windows will handle.

Please revert this patch, it should send out Win+O instead (or it needs
another keycode added).

(Also, even if the code ultimately lands in the platform tree, it would
be nice to send the linux-input list a copy of those types of patches,
where this problem would have been caught earlier).

Cheers
