It will *often* do so, you assume the thinkpad firmware is far more well
behaved than it really is :-(

It is model/bios-revision specific.  Fortunately, it should works on
most models, and there really isn't a better way of doing this (other
than adding the event to the NVRAM poll set of some very old models,
which is also not worth doing unless you can actually test it).
