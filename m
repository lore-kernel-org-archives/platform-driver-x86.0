OK, if we aren't guaranteed for this to run on CPU 0 in the future, and this

I have removed this patch, and fixed up the merge conflicts of the remaining 6
patches here:

http://git.infradead.org/linux-platform-drivers-x86.git/shortlog/refs/heads/fujitsu

Michal / Jonathan, would you please review and let me know if this is what you
would have done / approve the rebase?

Thanks,
