As mentioned during the review of the thinkpad patches already, there is no
guarantee that all generation thinkpads actually generate events when setting
the brightness through calling into the BIOS, so doing this may cause actual
hotkey events to get swallowed. So lets just keep this as is.

Note I still need to test that a similar problem does not exist for the Dell
case.

Hans
