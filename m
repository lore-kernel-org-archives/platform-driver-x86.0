In making this change I believe you'll need to cache the values that you fo=
und from the
function mask to test them later too.
Here:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/acpi/sleep.c#L943

This is because later on both ACPI_LPS0_SCREEN_OFF and ACPI_LPS0_ENTRY are =
called
whether or not they both exist.  Fortunately looking at the DSDT in the att=
ached bug nothing
happens if calling the undefined Arg2 =3D=3D 0x05/Arg2 =3D=3D 0x06 but that=
 might not always
be the case.
