Thanks for the pointer Andy. OK, I can understand the argument of
Dmitry that platform-specific quirks do not belong to the device
drivers, even though in practice I'm not sure the cost of having a
separate platform driver for the purpose is always worth it - depends
on how "popular" the device is, I suppose.

But still, this can't justify non-modular platform code that will run
on every X86 system out there. Any piece of platform-specific quirks,
we should be able to build as a module, otherwise it simply doesn't
scale. PCI quirks and such are enough pain already without inventing
more flavors of bloat :-(
