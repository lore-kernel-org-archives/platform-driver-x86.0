Something that occurred to me today is we could include in the API of the WMI
device the potential return of -EBUSY anytime the kernel decides it can't safely
service a call. This would avoid *changing* the API exposed to userspace, but it
could change the behavior and availability of certain methods.

Yes, this is already queued up for next week, and will be targeted at the 4.13
merge window.

Ah, that's good insight, thank you.

Oh wow. That's... that's just horrible. :-(

Do you have an idea as to the relative complexity of this format? Does it make
sense for us to attempt to decompile it? Presumably this would be done in
userspace ... although seeing as how we have drivers using this functionality,
it would be useful to be able to parse this from the kernel as well. Hrm.

Definitely *not* a perfect world :-)

Time to level this up. I'll draft something up and try to get Linus and Greg to
weigh in.

I'm not following the "At least until a way to deconstruct binary MOF is made
available" relates to making the pipe as you called it available?

The pipe would provide a WMI chardev which usespace could open and write a
method ID and arguments to, and read a response. That is necessary whether or
not the MOF data is legible. Having the MOF data just means it's less work to
figure out exactly which method IDs are available and what arguments they
accept. Right?
