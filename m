The /proc/device-tree tarball: http://v3.sk/~lkundrak/olpc/xo1.tar
(Mirror: https://people.freedesktop.org/~lkundrak/olpc/xo1.tar)

My distro's dtc crashes with this (could be related to your recent dtc
fixes), the git tip needs -f to work around some funny property names.
I figure a raw data as opposed to a dts/dtb dump would be a better
idea.

Also, there's no phandles, so it's of rather limited use. If you need
those, then I can share a dump directly from ofw instead or patch the
kernel to fabricate and expose the phandle properties.

This is with the latest firmware. I guess the exact version is
somewhere within the device tree.
