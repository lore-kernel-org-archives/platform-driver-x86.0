Hum .. maybe, the best way to know would be to dump it in various
hardware states.

ERQ0 is initialized here (with 0x00):
                        Name (BUF1, Buffer (0x40)
                        {
                                /* 0000 */      0x01, 0x00, 0x00,
0xFF, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF,
                                /* 0008 */      0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF,
0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF,
                                /* 0010 */      0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00,
0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF,
                                /* 0018 */      0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF,

Take a look at eeepc-laptop, you can do most of the work with
acpi_evaluate_object (see write_acpi_int/read_acpi_init in
eeepc-laptop).

If you really need to access the EC directly, check ec_write()/ec_read(=
) calls.
