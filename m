this also was my first thought, but i recall the generic one copes w/
devices that have per-flag- instead of per channel-registers
(IOW: all direction flags in one register, all level flags in another).
correct me if I'm wrong ..

I actually considered writing a generic per-register driver, where one
just configures which bit does what. But it didn't feel worth the extra
effort yet. OTOH, if we would have lots of consumers, the situation
would be different.

Fixed.
Maybe I should write an automatic check for that ;-)

By the way: are there already some tools that actually operate on that ?

Ah, thanks, forgot that.

By the way: would it be a good idea to define a struct w/ bitfields
for the registers, instead of directly doing bitmask operations ?

hopefully never, but I'm a bit paranoid ;-)
Shall I kick out that check ?

I assumed the compiler would already emit the correct code (and not try
any optimizations) if the field is declared volatile. But I'll change it
to readl()/writel().

By the way: do we already have helpers for doing such bit operations on
mmapped registers ? (eg. similar to those in bitops.h)

Should it be written in two lines - like that ?

    if (!ptr)
        return -EINVAL;

Not sure. AFAIK, this function should check whether the requested pin is
available. Feels safer to me having this check.

found dev_get_platdata(const struct device *dev).

but nothing for working on struct platform_device directly - should we
introduce one ?

Which one shall I use instead ?

Typo, should have been GPL-2.0+.

hmm, haven't found a proper struct yet.

struct gpio indeed has a label and two int fields. but it doesn't seem
to be designed for holding register addresses ... using this one here
feels quite abusive. (and a waste of memory, too).

for consistency, I could rename 'name' to 'label', if you wish.


thanks for your review.
