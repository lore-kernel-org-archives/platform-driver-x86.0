You are right. The real ACPI ID of the device is FnBT0000 but the kernel
is uppercasing it.

# acpidump | grep -i -C1 FNBT0000
  0b30: 00 0a 00 0a 14 5b 82 34 46 4e 42 54 08 5f 48 49  .....[.4FNBT._HI=

  0b40: 44 0d 46 6e 42 54 30 30 30 30 00 08 5f 55 49 44  D.FnBT0000.._UID=

  0b50: 0a 00 08 46 4e 4c 4b 0a 01 14 11 46 4e 43 54 01  ...FNLK....FNCT.=



[*] In kernels <=3D  2.6.36 (Tested in 2.6.32 and 2.6.36) the ACPI ID is
registered as FnBT0000

# cat /sys/bus/acpi/devices/FnBT0000\:00/modalias
acpi:FnBT0000:

And the cmpc_keys driver of the classmate-laptop module recognized the
device as expected:

input: cmpc_keys as /devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXSYBUS:00/FnBT0000:00/input/in=
put5




[*] In kernels =3D> 2.6.37 (Tested in 2.6.37 and 2.6.39) the ACPI ID is
registered uppercased as FNBT0000 and therefore the cmpc_keys driver fail=
s
to recognize it.

# cat /sys/bus/acpi/devices/FNBT0000\:00/modalias
acpi:FNBT0000:



[*] With the kernel 2.6.39.1 and your patch for drivers/acpi/scan.c the
ACPI ID is registered uppercased as FNBT0000 *but* the cmpc_keys driver
recognizes it.

# cat /sys/bus/acpi/devices/FNBT0000\:00/modalias
acpi:FNBT0000:

input: cmpc_keys as /devices/LNXSYSTM:00/device:00/FNBT0000:00/input/inpu=
t5


[*] With the kernel 2.6.39.1 and the commit
77b23f712bc40a65160e7d02b045f1562bb43ff1 reverted happens the same that
with kernels <=3D 2.6.36 (the ACPI ID is registered as FnBT0000)

Yes, we have three options here to solve the problem but I'm not sure whi=
ch
one is the correct.

At least I think it has been demonstrated that the ACPI ID is *not
required* to be uppercase by the ACPI specification as you can see in the=

acpidump of this device (FnBT0000).

So probably the "orthodox" way of solving this problem is reverting the
commit 77b23f712bc40a65160e7d02b045f1562bb43ff1 which is doing a wrong
assumption (its not true that the ACPI ID _must_ be uppercase).
