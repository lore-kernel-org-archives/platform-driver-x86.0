Apple laptops with hybrid graphics have a device named gmux that is used
for switching between GPUs and backlight control. On many models this is
the only reliable method for controlling the backlight.

This series adds initial support for the gmux device, along with
anciallary support for disabling apple_bl when the gmux device is
detected. Initially only backlight control is supported.

Changes since v2:

 - Add prerequisite patch for apple_bl to support disabling this
   backlight when a gmux backlight device is present.

 - Unregister acpi_video when a gmux backlight device is present.

Thanks,
Seth
