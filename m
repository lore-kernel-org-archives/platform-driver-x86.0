Yes, this is what I already pointed... That we should send event also=20
for tpacpi::thinklight.

It is problem? Or are forced to send event only if brightness level is=20
really changed? I think that bigger problem is when brightness changes,=20
but we do not send event.

Should not be event treated as "hey, brightness level was probably=20
changed, read file to get current status"?

Great, this is really useful to see somebody who can test patches on=20
those machines with both Thinklight and keyboard backlight...
