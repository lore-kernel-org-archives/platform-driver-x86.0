So this patch and the next 2 should probably be rearranged so that you
are adding functionality a piece at a time instead of just placing large
chunks in at once.

So normally you don't want to just add defines like this.  Instead it
would be better to add the defines as you need them.  So this patch
should really be broken up into several pieces and joined in as you add
functionality for various pieces.

It might be better to just define some masks and shifts instead of
creating all these bitfield unions.  It would probably make things a lot
less complicated since you wouldn't have to define a special union for
each register.

It is usually easier to define a write that way rather than having to
create a union and populate the bits before you can write it.  I've
found that there are a number of GCC versions that don't exactly do the
smartest things when it comes to bitfields.

Should automak be automask?  Just wondering if that is a typo.  Also if
this is a mostly reserved 0 register you could probably save yourself
some trouble and just use the reg as-is without the need for the union.

So for example you would just define a value such as:
#define FJES_ICTL_AUTOMASK	0x00000001

Then all you do is write that value when you want to enable it, or write
0 to disable it.

You could probably reverse the order of this for readability.  It is
better to go from 16 to 20 rather than 20 to 16.

I would update the 2 lines so that indentation for the = matched.  It
looks like the GENMASK is tabbed over one additional tab.
