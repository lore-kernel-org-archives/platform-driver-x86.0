What I'm trying to tell is about consistency of style.

So, imagine if we have two bitfields in some register, one with one
bit and the other with two.
And for latter one only 3 states are possible (00, 10, 11), so,

REG1_FLDA  BIT(0)
REG1_FLDB_STATE0  0
REG1_FLDB_STATE2  BIT(2)
REG1_FLDB_STATE3  BIT(2) | BIT(3) // or 0x6, or (3 << 1)

Above is not what I would like to see.

The consistent may be one of the following

REG1_FLDA  BIT(0)
REG1_FLDB_STATE0  (0 << 1)
REG1_FLDB_STATE2  (2 << 1)
REG1_FLDB_STATE3  (3 << 1)

or (implying that in the code _SHIFT is used)

REG1_FLDA  BIT(0)
REG1_FLDB_SHIFT  1
REG1_FLDB_STATE0  0
REG1_FLDB_STATE2  2
REG1_FLDB_STATE3  3

or (perhaps less wanted)

REG1_FLDA  (1 << 0)
REG1_FLDB_STATE0  (0 << 1)
REG1_FLDB_STATE2  (2 << 1)
REG1_FLDB_STATE3  (3 << 1)

--=20
