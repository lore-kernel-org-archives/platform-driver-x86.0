This patch series implements the device side platform driver
support for the TmFifo on Mellanox BlueField SoC.

TmFifo is part of the RShim component. It provides FIFOs to
communicate with external host machine via USB or PCIe (SmartNic
case). External host machine has driver to access the RShim
component as well, which is not covered in this patch series.

This patch series was submitted to drivers/soc in previous versions.
This version (v8) re-submit it to drivers/platform according to
the received comments / suggestions.

Patch v8 1/2 has changes according to some comments from Vadim
Pasternak during Mellanox internal review.

Patch v8 2/2 was reviewed by Rob Herring before, but might need
a second look since the location of the driver code is moved.
