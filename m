Pali, forgive me, but I fail to understand your last two sentences.
Currently, we don't have functions for allocating/freeing the SMBIOS
buffer as it is allocated in dell_init() (or dell_smbios_init() after
applying this patch series) and freed in dell_(smbios_)exit().

In your previous messages [1][2], you suggested that we could allocate =
a
separate SMBIOS buffer for each caller or copy input parameters from
caller-allocated memory into a module-wide SMBIOS buffer before
performing the SMBIOS request.  Did you just mean to remind Darren of
these ideas or did you have something else on your mind?  If the latter=
,
could you please try rephrasing the last two sentences of your message?
