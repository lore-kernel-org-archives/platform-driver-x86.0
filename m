I didn't write a new MTD device driver, but just moved the already
existing one to the ts5500 platform directory. The point is that my
TS-5500 doesn't have this flash, so I couldn't try. The fifth patch
from this set could just be ignored.

I'm a bit confused with what should be done for the support for an
embedded platform (X86-based) like this TS-5500. Is the actual code
hierarchy OK? What is the impact of adding a device-tree to this code?

Thanks,
Vivien.
