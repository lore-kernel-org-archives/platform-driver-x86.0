Hi All,

Here is the long promised rewrite / cleanup of the acpi-video
(and platform/x86) backlight interface selection logic.

Reviewers do not be alarmed by the large number of patches, the gist
of the series is in patches 6-13, the earlier ones are a few simple
prepararion patches, and the later ones all port over drivers to the
new API one at a time.

I've had to jump through some hoops to make it possible to still build the
acpi_video code as a module. One downside of this is that the kernel
commandline parameters have a changed prefix now. If people do not like
this, an alternative would to change CONFIG_ACPI_VIDEO from a tristate to
a bool, iow either build it in, or do not build it at all.

Regards,

Hans
