After check.
Acer moved to WMI for hotkey function on notebook/netbook from 2010.=20

But if the hotkey have standard scan code (Ex. Volume up/down,
Play/Pause, =C2=A1K), it will keep scan code.

Also check why have default EC "raw" behavior in wifi hotkey before
enable launch manager mode, That's because they want to cover end user
install Windows 98 or other old Windows not support wmi.
