Why would it need to? It could look at default triggers for the led if
it really wanted to.

Are all the possibilities useful? I assumed about 2 are. If you need
2**7 of them, LED triggers can have parameters.

How is that concept used outside the LEDs? What semantics does
"airplane mode" have? You tried to explain "airplane mode" is not well
defined up in this thread...

I'm not saying that. I'm saying that LED maintainers should be Cced,
to keep the interfaces consistent.
