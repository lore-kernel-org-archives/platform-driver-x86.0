No, I unloaded ath10k_pci, and that takes a few seconds, and also shows 
the Linux error messages in the log. Loading it again, there are also 
Linux error messages, and the wireless does *not* work again.

Yes, it looks like it gets loaded after I removed it from `/etc/modules`.

Still, that behavior should not happen. Could you reproduce it? Is it 
actually a ath10k_pci bug, and their maintainers should be added?


Kind regards,
