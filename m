Hi Corentin,

Thanks for your feedback on this. Indeed, what Olof is saying is
correct. In its current form, this driver exists to register i2c
devices on our laptops. We have one piece of information (the irq,
specifically) that cannot be added to the i2c_board_info when using
user space probing.

To answer your question about where this driver is going in the
future, you can take a look at the current version of the driver in
the chromiumos kernel:

https://gerrit.chromium.org/gitweb/?p=chromiumos/third_party/kernel.git;a=blob;f=drivers/platform/x86/chromeos_laptop.c;h=f948f61d864a5265f6e144833358512f68b7e467;hb=chromeos-3.4

I added more i2c devices that are registered the same way for a number
of other chromeos systems, but there is one platform device (a
keyboard backlight) that is added using
platform_device_register_simple.

Thanks again for reviewing,
Benson
