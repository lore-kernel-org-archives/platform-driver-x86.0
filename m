I did another quick test and moved the code so that it is executed
before has_persistent_clock() is checked. Everything seems to be
working as intended. I tried to suspend and resume multiple times
within one minute and exactly one minute after the last suspension
the system transitioned from S3 to S4.

I haven't checked properly whether it is OK or not to simply move
the code or not, but I wanted to let you know that it works.
