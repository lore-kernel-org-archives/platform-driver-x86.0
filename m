I won't repeat Andy's review, so please incorporate his suggestions unless I
specifically contradict him below... (which I don't intend to do...)

Please define less common acronymns the first time they are used:

This provides a good description of what IMRs are and how they are used on X1000
SoCs, but it doesn't tell me what to expect in the following patch.

Since you have Intel (C) below and then your own, are you the sole author?

It supports manipulating them specifically, correct? No support is needed to
trigger an IMR violation and reboot the system, that happens in
hardware/firmware without any OS involvement. So we're specifically providing
the means to manipulate the IMRs.

Hrm, I thought there were 8?

The above text block is oddly formatted. Please wrap to a uniform width (72 or
so) and use a blank line between paragraphs.

Also in the datasheet here:

With the exception of bit 30, also marked as reserved per the above datasheet.
I'd prefer to reference the datasheet where possible rather than soon to be
obsolete code (assuming this is meant to replace it?)

> + * 29:25	Reserved

The above spec uses 23:2. Is it incorrect?

Perhaps call the imr imr_regs so nobody breaks this in the future by adding
something other than a u32 to it? Alternatively, use a datatype that enforces
this... like the union Andy suggested...

What are testing here? You have bit 30 marked as "Enabled" above (but it isn't
in the datasheet). With Reserved bits in each register, this test for non-zero
doesn't seem robust.

According to the datasheet, overlapping ranges are valid, and access must be
granted by all IMRs associated with a given address. Why declare an overlap as
invalid here?
