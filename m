I guess the world wouldn't end then (it has not ended for far more serious
reasons so far after all), but this also doesn't feel entirely right.

For one, if something is used inside of the kernel (by drivers etc), then
allowing user space to use the same thing directly is a recipe for unsupportable
mess IMO.

To me, that should be the bare minimum, but I really think that mutual exclusion
between user space and the kernel needs to be ensured somehow when the
interface is enabled too.

This looks similar to exposing _DSM functionality for certain device to user
space where some functions of the _DSM in question are already in use by
kernel code.  In that case I would think about an interface with a function
granularity (so it would check the GUID and the function and possibly the
ordering with respect to the other functions too before invoking the _DSM
on behalf of user space).

Thanks,
