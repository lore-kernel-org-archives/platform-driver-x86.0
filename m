I don't quite follow, that should be fixed by commit 07f4f97d7b4b
("vga_switcheroo: Use device link for HDA controller") which landed
in v4.17-rc1.

My understanding was that with SG enabled, the external DP/HDMI ports
are muxed to the Intel GPU, so audio can only be streamed to external
displays by the Intel HDA, not by the HDA integrated into the discrete
AMD/Nvidia GPU.  Audio streamed to the latter would essentially end up
in a blackhole.  And preventing the user from seeing such useless audio
devices was the sole purpose of this commit.  Am I missing something?

Thanks,

Lukas
