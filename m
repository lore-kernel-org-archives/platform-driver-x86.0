We are of course strongly opposed to adding module options.

I agree we can't ignore Xorg.

I agree policy in general should not be in the kernel.

I also see many of these drivers as the last mile to getting a platform
fully working. If there is a place for one-off fixes, it's in these
drivers. I'd love to refactor and use proper abstractions and all that
as the patterns make those abstractions clear - but I don't want to
delay getting something working waiting for the ideal solution.

So I have two questions I'd like to confirm before saying "OK" to a
module option.

1) Hans I think you said that doing the code conversion from TOGGLE to
UP based on the LED value and the max value was racy with userspace.
What is the failure mode here? Is it not easily recoverable? And how do
I enter it? Do I have to simultaneously modify the software brightness
control AND press the keyboard brightness control? How practical is
that? If recoverable AND hard to trigger, I think there is value in the
very simple 3 level brightness cycle being handled in the kernel.

2) Why is a module option preferable to a compile time option? It seems
to me the policy will be largely distro dependent, and the same kernel
needing to support both modes seems likely to be pretty rare.
