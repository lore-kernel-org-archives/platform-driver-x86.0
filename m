The extcon core don't know the caller situation is in either probe() or other position
in the caller driver. The caller driver should decide the kind of error value
by using the return value of extcon_get_extcon_dev().

extcon_get_extcon_dev() function cannot be modified for only one case.
If some device driver call extcon_get_extcon_dev() out of probe() fuction,
EPROBE_DEFER is not always correct.
