If we have a keyboard backlight that may be changed automatically, I'd
go for trigger. If we know for sure that hardware will not change
brightnes "on its own", I'd not put a trigger there (and polling makes
no sense). If we don't know... I guess I'd go for trigger.

We can do various white/blacklists if we really want to..

Well, if we know that hardware will not change the brightness on its
own, yes, I'd avoid the trigger. If we don't know (as is common on
ACPI machines, I'd keep the trigger).

Best regards,
