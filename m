Agreed, but I don't think that's specific to this patch.

I think the real answer would be to fix kconfig to also show menu items
whose dependencies are not met, and then recursively enabling the
dependencies when the item is enabled. Beyond my scope.

I think it should be possible to choose between y and m when it's
selected, and it should be possible to enable it when it's not selected
by any drivers. I'm not sure a hidden option is good for that.

At least for drm/i915 BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE is "an option". We use it
if it's enabled, but we are just fine if it's not. I've learned the way
to express that is

	depends on BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE || BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE=n

but I don't think there's a way to express that in terms of select, is
there? The dependency above guarantees there's no DRM_I915=y and
BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE=m combo which would fail. And this, btw, is where
this whole patch got started, as select didn't handle that properly.

> I didn't look at the ACPI_VIDEO side, so no idea how messy that is.

Basically it's another dependency on BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE. I can only
imagine trying to solve this problem with select is going to end up in
recursive dependencies that spread out and need changing about as wide
as this patch.

In the end, I agree with the problem you have with this patch, but yet I
think it's the right thing to do in terms of expressing the
dependencies.
