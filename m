AFAIK, This behavior goes back to the initial SBS implementation in the
IBM era ECs of the Thinkpads...  We've always called it "idle" in the
linux-thinkpad community.  The behavior comes from SBS
(http://smartbattery.org/specs/), the EC was reporting its status
(charging/not charging *THIS* battery) in one bit, and the battery's
status (discharging/not discharging *THIS* battery) in a different bit.

It was rather simple to observe the behavior of those bits in a
two-battery system.

Would that apply to these newer Lenovo models?  If so, you might want to
consider using "idle", instead. "not charging" does _not_ imply "neither
charging nor discharging", while "idle" does.
