Yes, for the platform code.

Platform code tears-down IMRs and sets-up up a new one around the 
kernel. Quark BSP does a similar thing in a different place.

To be safe I'm happy to add a Intel (C) to this file anyway.

Exactly.

True - I'll add that statement to the description.

Done.

There are. All of the loops look like this

for (i = 0; i <= imr_dev.num; i++)

aka

for (i = 0; i <= QUARK_X1000_IMR_NUM; i++)

Worth changing IMR_NUM to 8 and changing the loops to < IMR_NUM to 
remove confusion.

Fair point. I'll refer to the spec directly for all of the bits.

I'll take a look and see which suggestion fits better

Good question.

Bit 30 is not present in X1000 silicon, though is present in the BSP 
code. Lets forget about all non-X1000 cases for now since X1000 is the 
only processor currently available.

On X1000 the only means of determining if an IMR is enabled is if it's 
address bits are set to some address everybody agrees means 'off', since 
the enable bit doesn't exist. Everybody in this case is ROM, BIOS, 2nd 
stage bootloader and kernel.

In the BSP code, that address is zero. So in lieu of bit 30 'enable' we 
have address 0x00000000.

The kernel could define an alternative address to 0x00000000 but, then 
this would break with the convention in BIOS etc.

Since BIOS and grub code both use 0x00000000 as the 'off' address I 
think it makes sense for the kernel to continue to use that address.

Simplicity.

It's more straight forward to define your IMR memory map if you don't 
allow the address ranges to stomp all over each other.

None of the BSP reference code does overlap.

If there's an argument for an overlap use-case it can be supported 
pretty simply by simply removing the overlap checks.

My own view is that it's not really desirable and easier to debug IMRs 
generally on a platform if overlaps aren't allowed.
