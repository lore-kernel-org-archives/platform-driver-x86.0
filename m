Hi All,

I've marked this as a RFC because I'm waiting for feedback from the
bug-reporter to check if this actually fixes his issue. But I fully
expect it will (I already tested this on some of my own hw).

IOW I don't expect this patch to change before I will merge it,
so please review.

Here is more info from the commit msg:

"""
Various 360 degree hinges (yoga) style 2-in-1 devices use 2 accelerometers
to allow the OS to determine the angle between the display and the base of
the device.

On Windows these are read by a special HingeAngleService process which
calls undocumented ACPI methods, to let the firmware know if the 2-in-1 is
in tablet- or laptop-mode. The firmware may use this to disable the kbd and
touchpad to avoid spurious input in tablet-mode as well as to report
SW_TABLET_MODE info to the OS.

Since Linux does not call these undocumented methods, the SW_TABLET_MODE
info reported by various pdx86 drivers is incorrect on these devices.

Before this commit the intel-hid and thinkpad_acpi code already had 2
hardcoded checks for ACPI hardware-ids of dual-accel sensors to avoid
reporting broken info.

And now we also have a bug-report about the same problem in the intel-vbtn
code. Since there are at least 3 different ACPI hardware-ids in play, add
a new dual_accel_detect() helper which checks for all 3, rather then
adding different hardware-ids to the drivers as bug-reports trickle in.
"""

Regards,

Hans
