Well if we're doing this for the user's benefit (most WARNs are for developers)
then the message should be user-useful.  That one isn't, really.

Can we come up with some text which is more useful to the user/operator and
won't require him/her/it to send emails and raise bug reports?

Also, the stack trace which WARN emits is not useful in this application?
