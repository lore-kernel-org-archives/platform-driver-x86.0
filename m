Yes, it appears to do that as part of _OSC.

The disassembled DSDT table is here:

OK, that might indeed work.

The ideapad driver currently skips registration of the backlight device
if acpi_video_backlight_support() returns true. is that all you need?

Hmm, regarding your patch series, do you plan to skip the registration
of the acpi backlight device if the "raw" device is supported? I mean,
the intel driver could be compiled as a module (and generally is on the
popular distros), so at the time the ACPI subsystem wants to register
the backlight device and know if a raw backlight device is around it
never will be, so what is the point of that? Or am I missing something?
