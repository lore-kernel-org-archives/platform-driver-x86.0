The actual question is whether it is really required that the firmware
is loaded by the kernel into a buffer that is already mapped for DMA
at that point, and thus accessible by the device.

To me, it is not entirely clear what the nature is of the firmware
that we are talking about, since it seems to be getting passed to the
secure world as well?

In any case, the preferred model in terms of validation/sig checking is

1) allocate a CPU accessible buffer

2) request the firmware into it (which may include a sig check under the hood)

3) map the buffer for DMA to the device so it can load the firmware.

4) kick off the DMA transfer.

The use of dma_alloc_coherent() for this purpose seems unnecessary,
given that the DMA transfer is not bidirectional. Would it be possible
to replace it with something like the above sequence?
