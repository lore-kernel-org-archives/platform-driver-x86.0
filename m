This is  a debug interface nobody should rely on or use in real applications.
There should only exist one app which dumps the EC or write modify single
bytes/fields and this one shouldn't be called twice in parallel.
My idea was: if someone accesses this file simultaneously, something is
wrong in userspace and it's even safer...

On the other hand side, the ec.c code should already parallelize register 
accesses  and the whole lock should not be needed at all.
Someone might want to check whether the locks
in ec.c really do what they should and could use this as a stress test if the 
lock is simply removed.

Not sure it really matters. But removing it altogether might be even better.
Waiting for some more comments...
