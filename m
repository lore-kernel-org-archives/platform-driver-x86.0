I don't think I'm seeing the "is too hot" messages. Actually.. even
the "THERMAL EMERGENCY" messages seem to have too low severity, so
they are hidden in syslogs -- they don't go to all the consoles.

Sorry, just guidance for now:

+#include <linux/reboot.h>
+               orderly_poweroff(true);

[can be called from weird contexts, afaict].=20

Actually, the machine _will_ shut down some time after that. It seems
that one of acpi trip points jumps to 128C which forces shutdown.

Thanks and best regards,
