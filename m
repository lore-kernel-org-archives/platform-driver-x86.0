Yes of course, but the actual accelerometer device (sensor?) is not
really exposed,
only certain "functions" it provides, and they are divided across two
different ACPI devices,
TOS620A exposes the protection, and the TOS1900 (and et. al.) only
exposes the axes.

I see your point in breaking userspace, but given the fact that it was
recently introduced,
I didn't thought it was already "adopted", that's why I decided to
remove the sysfs entry.

Then we might as well keep the sysfs entry and have the input polled
device as well.
