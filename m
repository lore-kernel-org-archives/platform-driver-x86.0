Hmm, I suppose I could look for the specific WMI event guid, although
the relationship between the two seems tenuous at best. It would make
sense to me if we were refusing to bind because there was a better
interface available, but Toshiba is obviously treating hotkeys on the
WMI interface as legacy since it's disabled in the BIOS for Vista or
later. INFO seems to be the preferred interface.
