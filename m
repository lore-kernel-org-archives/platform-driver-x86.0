but LEDS_CLASS is only available if NEW_LEDS is set/enabled, so it either
depends on LEDS_CLASS... or it needs to select NEW_LEDS, which is what other
drivers in this Kconfig file do, even though our b.d. has said a few times
that any one driver should not "select" => enable an entire subsystem,
so they all should be "depends on NEW_LEDS" IMHO.
