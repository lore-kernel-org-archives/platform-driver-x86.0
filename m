the bug reproduces on 7.3-rc4.

Built 7.3-rc4 from the torvalds snapshot, migrated my 6.18.51 config 
with make olddefconfig, IOMMU enabled, all 24 CPUs online, no IOMMU boot 
parameters. Same result: the machine suspends and never wakes, forced 
power off required.

Both attempts recorded by the same script, neither produced a resume block:

   === 2026-09-23T22:15:02 BEFORE
   cmdline:     (6.18.51, no iommu parameters)
   cpus online: 0-23
   iommu:       ivhd0
   ff_rt_clk:   0
   S0ix Entry Time: 0 / Exit Time: 0 / Residency Time: 0
   suspending with +30s alarm

   === 2026-09-23T22:39:06 BEFORE
   cmdline:     (7.3.0-rc4, no iommu parameters)
   cpus online: 0-23
   iommu:       ivhd0
   ff_rt_clk:   0
   S0ix Entry Time: 0 / Exit Time: 0 / Residency Time: 0
   suspending with +30s alarm

Both used a programmed RTC wakealarm at +30s and were left untouched for 
several minutes.

Relevant details of the 7.3-rc4 build, so this is not a configuration 
difference:

   CONFIG_AMD_IOMMU=y, CONFIG_IOMMU_PT=y, CONFIG_IOMMU_PT_AMDV1=y
   CONFIG_NR_CPUS=24, CONFIG_MODULES not set
   CONFIG_DEBUG_FS=y, CONFIG_PM_DEBUG=y, CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG=y
   CONFIG_AMD_MP2_STB=y, CONFIG_X86_MSR=y, CONFIG_DMIID=y
   CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT=20, CONFIG_RANDSTRUCT_NONE=y
   kernel is not tainted, builds with zero warnings

Only 243 config lines differ between my 6.18.51 and 7.3-rc4 configs. 
Both commits you pointed me at are present in 7.3-rc4: rtc-cmos uses 
platform_get_irq_optional(), and iommu/amd carries the "No ACPI device 
matched UID" check. As on 6.18, that FW_BUG message does not appear here 
either.

Two things worth noting about the 7.3 build specifically. The new IOMMU 
page table layer is in use (CONFIG_IOMMU_PT / IOMMU_PT_AMDV1 replacing 
CONFIG_IOMMU_IO_PGTABLE), so that rework does not change the outcome. 
And AMD_PMF and DRM_ACCEL_AMDXDNA are not compiled into either kernel - 
DRM_ACCEL and AMD_SFH_HID are both off in my config - so neither driver 
is involved in any of these results at all, which is a stronger 
statement than the initcall_blacklist tests I reported earlier.

Where that leaves things. With the IOMMU enabled and all 24 CPUs, on 
both 6.18.51 and 7.3-rc4:

   lid switch, internal keyboard, power button, USB mouse with wakeup
   armed, and a programmed ACPI RTC alarm        all fail to wake

   intremap=off, iommu=pt, amd_iommu_intr=legacy  all still hang
   pm_test freezer / devices / platform           all pass
   PC6 and CC6 enabled per amd-s2idle             yes

   amd_iommu=off                                  wakes normally,
                                                  Last S0i3 Status Success,
                                                  13.3s residency,
                                                  pm_wakeup_irq 9

Since it fails identically on 6.18 and 7.3 there is no working kernel 
version to bisect against. The only variable that changes the outcome is 
whether the IOMMU is enabled, and secondarily whether more than 16 CPUs 
are brought up at boot.
