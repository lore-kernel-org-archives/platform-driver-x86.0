Hi Martin,

Thank you for looking into this problem. Obviously, this is a problem
Olof and our team has been working on as well.

I would be hesitant to use .detect(), as its use will have unintended
side effects. I'll give you a real world example of what can happen
with your driver.

Here I've run the i2cdetect command on an actual Chromebook platform.
The name of the bus is SMBus I801 adapter at 0400, so it will be
triggered by your detect.

localhost ~ # i2cdetect -y 8
     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
00:          -- -- -- -- -- 08 -- -- -- -- -- -- --
10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
30: -- -- -- -- -- 35 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
40: -- -- -- -- 44 -- -- -- -- -- 4a 4b -- -- -- --
50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

Your driver will try to instantiate device 0x44, the isl29018 ambient
light sensor, device 0x4a, an Atmel touchscreen, and device 0x4b, an
Atmel touchpad.

The problem is that none of those devices actually exist on this
particular system's SMBus.
These are other i2c clients that just happen to share the same
addresses as devices on other buses on other supported systems. 0x44,
for example, is the Intel PCH SMBus's host Receive Slave Address
Register. It just happens to have the same address as the isl29018.

Your driver would result in three failed probes in 2 different drivers
on my board.

Furthermore, I would recommend reading the documentation on
instantiating i2c devices :
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices

The documentation outlines the four methods that are supported for
instantiating i2c devices. "Detect" is method #3, but it comes with a
stern warning : Once again, method 3 should be avoided wherever
possible. Explicit device instantiation (methods 1 and 2) is much
preferred for it is safer and faster.

That is actually not true. The intention is for chromeos_laptop to
eventually instantiate devices other than i2c devices, actually. The
chromeos-kernel version of this driver actually supports the
Chromebook Pixel's keyboard backlight, which is not an i2c device but
a platform device, so making this driver a platform driver is more
appropriate.

As I mentioned before, the patch causes problems on other Chromebook
systems I have tested with devices with colliding addresses on SMBus.
