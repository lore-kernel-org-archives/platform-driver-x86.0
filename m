I uploaded acpidump files [1] (except for XPS 13 which is not
available), and this should help clarify what has been tested.

Does Inspirion 5721 does not have either DELLABCE or DELRBTN. It is
used for comparison. My apologies that I did not point this out in
previous email.

When calling ARBT(1), BIOS will no longer issue scancode and will not
pull low hardware pin "W_DISABLE#" on mini card. This essentially
gives all wireless control to OS. This is likely the answer to
Microsoft's Windows Certification Program
System.Client.RadioManagement.HardwareButton [2] as below:

=============================================
If a PC has a physical (hardware) button switch on a PC that turns
wireless radios on and off, it must be software controllable and
interact appropriately with the Radio Management UI
=============================================

Dell's BIOS does issue a notify(RBTN, 0x80). This is done purposely to
re-enumerate the state of radio switch which may be changed when
system is in S3 or S4. I think this should not occur when CRBT returns
0 or 1 (for hotkey that cannot be changed during S3 or S4), but that's
how it is done currently.

dell-wireless does not handle this notification in S3 or S4 for
following reasons:

1. dell-wireless does not handle slider (i.e. CRBT = 2 or 3). Device
drivers should read the hardware pin, "W_DISABLE#" on mini spec and
change hard block accordingly. This pin is commonly used by OEM today.

2. it is not possible to distinguish the notification (0x80) from
hotkey press or S3/S4. I also concerned this may mis-trigger state
change when resuming from S3 or S4, but it does not. Does any know how
to ignore this notification during resume only?

dell-rbtn can use this notification + method (GRBT) [2] to solve the
problem that slider state.

[1] http://people.canonical.com/~alexhung/dell-acpidump/
[2] http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/jj128256.aspx
[3] It seems GRBT may not always be implemented...

I'd love to do more tests and share the results on any particular
systems, but I may need some more detailed instructions.
