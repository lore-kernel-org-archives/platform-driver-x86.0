The main practical drawback of this approach IMO is that we can't
guarantee that userspace processes will not step on each other's toes
trying to control the LED concurrently. But I guess that is something
that userspace will have to solve for now, I rather get this moving
without the trigger than not moving at all.

IMO "airplane" (or maybe "airplane-mode") is a better suffix, as it
reflects the label on the machine's chassis. I'll name it
"asus-wireless::airplane" and send this through platform-drivers-x86,
as this is now contained in the platform-drivers-x86 subsystem. Thanks
Johannes for your patience and help designing and reviewing the rfkill
changes, even if not all of them made it through in the end. And
thanks everyone else involved for the feedback.
