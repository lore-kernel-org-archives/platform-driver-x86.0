Hi Hans,

How about exploiting recently added userspace driver for the LED
subsystem ((drivers/leds/uleds.c, available in linux-next) instead?

If the LED class device to be observed implemented its internal trigger
for generating kernel events upon device brightness change, then the
userspace could create virtual LED class device, register on the
trigger and poll the obtained file descriptor.

See tools/leds/uledmon.c.

Best regards,
Jacek Anaszewski
