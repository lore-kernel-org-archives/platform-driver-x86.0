Right, we can hack around it based on what we've seen so far. But it 
seems more attractive to fix it in such a way that we won't behave 
inappropriately even if someone does do something utterly unexpected in 
future. For instance, some ARM devices have i8042-like serio - if the 
underlying device is exposed in device tree, it'd be nice to be able to 
expose that to userspace without having to modify the core X code.
