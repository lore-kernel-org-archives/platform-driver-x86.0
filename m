Hi,

https://sashiko.dev is the goto place where you have them for all public=20
submissions covered.

It's intentional that we don't encumber (spam) our first time submitters=20
with gazillions of pre-existing problems sashiko finds. Many of which are=
=20
largely irrelevant/low value for platform drivers anyway (what user would=
=20
remove a platform driver? or probe() rollback path issues; nice to fix=20
those as well but nowhere near urgent or important level).

Sashiko has gotten somewhat better in not spamming the submitters with all=
=20
such pre-existing issues but tries to filter only the ones somewhat=20
relevant to the patch so I might reconsider that.

Sashiko's review emails together with using LLM to create and update=20
patches also have a tendencity to cause undesirable rapid patch respinning=
=20
cycle no human reviewer wants to see in their inboxes so it's a=20
double-edged sword. I don't want to see v10 in a week or two from=20
starting, it seems counterproductive as it's discouraging to human=20
reviewers.

In this case you need to read between the lines as the report is for the=20
Documentation patch, whereas I think it's an indication of a more generic=
=20
problem in the code that isn't a mere documentation issue.

So if there's only the FF..FE return with high value, it doesn't seem=20
problem because it's explicilty checked for but I recall there was also=20
FF..FF somewhere (no longer sure if I remember even what driver it was=20
but the numbers seems suspiciously close to ones used here), it's not=20
being checked in ..._buf() case and casting that to int makes it to alias=
=20
with -EPERM.
