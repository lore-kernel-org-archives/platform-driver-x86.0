Well that sucks - a userspace interface which is _designed_ to randomly
and rarely fail?

An application tries to open the thing and gets -EBUSY, what's it
supposed to do?  Sleep and try again?  Crash and dump core?

Also the code's uncommented, so the reader has no clue why a trylock
was used.  There are very few circumstances where any trylock can
acceptably be left uncommented.

afacit we can use mutex_lock() here and the implementation would be
heaps better.
