FWIW after my flip-flop to agreeing with Dmitry that the 2
(inhibit vs wakeup) should be completely orthogonal this new
policy is stable/mature from my pov (and consistent with how
we handle wakeup vs input_dev->users).

I still think it would be good to do a follow-up documentation
patch documenting that these (and esp. inhibit) are orthogonal.

This will mean for example that if a device is inhibit but
still wakeup enabled and the device's close method silences
the devices, that it needs to be unsilenced in suspend.
This might be worth mentioning in the docs even though
drivers which silence the device on close should already
unsilence the device on suspend when it is wakeup-enabled.

Note maybe we should give it a couple of days for others to
give their opinion before you submit the follow-up documentation
patch.

Regards,

Hans
