While researching something else, I noticed that the PCI Firmware Spec, rev
3.2, does indeed call out _PRS and _SRS as the mechanism for the OS to
configure host bridge windows.  See sections 4.1.3, 4.3.2.1, and 4.6.5.

Sec 4.6.5 also includes an implementation note that might be a clue about
the "compatibility issues" that prevent the BIOS from enabling the window
in the first place.

I'd like to incorporate some of this info into these changes, probably in a
code comment and changelog, so we can encourage a more generic approach in
the future, even if we can't use it in all existing cases.
