This is a driver for the Alienware X51, X51 R2 and some future HW.
 - For the X51 / X51 R2 it allows control of the color and brightness
   of each zone via a sysfs interface for the color and a LED interface
   for the brightness
 - For the future HW it allows control of color and brightness as well
   as an HDMI mux that's included in the HW.

Changes from v4 to v5:
 - Make zone control more like the thingm RGB LED in the kernel.  Brightness
   control is independent of the RGB adjustment.  RGB adjustment takes a 24-bit
   hexadecimal triplet.
 - Introduced a new WMAX method for platforms that use HDMI as well as a new
   lighting control interface.  This removes the present necessity of having
   to do a DMI match on HDMI for now.
 - Dynamically create number of sysfs zone nodes based on DMI data. Present
   platforms have 3 nodes, but some future ones will have anywhere from 2
   to 32 nodes.
 - Make lighting control state and HDMI more readable and usable for 
   interacting. Rather than having to know numbers, cat'ing the nodes will
   output the available options and the presently selected option (in a 
   single line)
