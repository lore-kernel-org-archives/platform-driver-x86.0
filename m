Hi Old=C5=99ich,

Sorry bother you again, but after discuss with Johannes, he remind me
one import thing: maybe your BT HW key emit scancode and wmi event at
the same time.

My Acer TravelMate 8572 is commercial notebook, it only emit wmi event
when press wifi key. But, as I remember, there have some acer consumer
notebook emit both scancode and wmi event.=20

New acer-wmi driver will transfer wmi event to keycode (e.g.
KEY_BLUETOOTH), if EC also emit KEY_BLUETOOTH, the rfkill-input will
receive the key events twice, that means:
	global BT block (when system boot) -> BT unblock (from EC scancode) ->=
 BT block (from acer-wmi)

Could you please help me to check?
	- If your distro still have HAL, please run:
		+ lshal -l -m
		+ press BT HW key 1 time
		then check does HAL receive KEY_BLUETOOTH twice?
	- Or, please try the following patch, it removed
	  KEY_BLUETOOTH support in acer-wmi. If removed it but the BT killswit=
ch
	  still can reserve when you press BT HW key, that means not just
	  acer-wmi emit KEY_BLUETOOTH:


Thank's a lot!
Joey Lee
