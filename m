Yes, use rfill_init_sw_state to set the initial state from BIOS to
killswitch is make sense.

But, it looks like have tricky effect when rfkill-input enabled.

Yes, per Alan's patch, there have another issue need to workaround by
set the block state to global, and those code might need removed in the
future:

=2E...

    Drivers with persistent state will affect the global state only if
    rfkill-input is enabled.  This is required, otherwise booting with
    wireless soft-blocked and pressing the wireless-toggle key once wou=
ld
    have no apparent effect.  This special case will be removed in futu=
re
    along with rfkill-input, in favour of a more flexible userspace dae=
mon
    (see Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt).

But,=20
the above code replicate acer-wmi's initial state to global, then set t=
o hci0's
BT initial state.

I already have a patch to use acer-wmi_notify to set device state:
http://www.spinics.net/lists/platform-driver-x86/msg01645.html

It didn't accept, yet. But, even have this patch, there still have some
old acer machine need use polling way because those machines have no wm=
i
event notify.

I have no Bluetooth HW key on my machine, but Old=C5=99ich can reproduc=

issue by HW key.

The "the design" means call rfkill_init_sw_state before rfkill register=
?

>  a) the bios stores the last state

This issue happen when "Bluetooth's initial state is disabled before
system boot.", maybe user choice disable bluetooth at last time reboot,
then BIOS keep BT disable.

>=20

No, BT HW key doesn't emit KEY_BLUETOOTH, it emit wmi event, then
acer-wmi driver transfer to KEY_BLUETOOTH. Then I think rfkill-input (i=
f
enabled) also receive KEY_BLUETOOTH.

I thought maybe it's a race condition the hci0 rfkill generated before
rfkill-input key work for update the global state ?

>=20

So, we should remove the following statement in
Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt ?

What:   CONFIG_RFKILL_INPUT
When:   2.6.33
Why:    Should be implemented in userspace, policy daemon.
Who:    Johannes Berg <johannes-cdvu00un1VgdHxzADdlk8Q@public.gmane.org>

> Of course, in this particular instance it _doesn't_ work out of the b=

>=20

Yes, if we want to keep the CONFIG_RFKILL_INPUT is !EXPERT, then I
thought we should try to fix it.

>=20

It's tricky to me for use rfkill_init_sw_state.

When rfkill-input disabled, everything works fine, but if rfkill-input
enabled, then I need very careful to know it will change the global
state and causes the global state replicate to any new rfkill.

Honest, I don't know the rfkill_init_sw_state have the above condition
before I read rfkill source code.

>=20

Yes, it's not good idea, BIOS can save device states when system reboot=
,
I don't want erase the state.

Thank's a lot!
