To simplify a bit what Sean said about the key difference to a standard
page is that in SGX a page is part of a hierarchical structure. EPC
pages have hardware enforced dependencies to each other.

Examples: 

1. You cannot delete or swap SECS before its children have been deleted or
   swapped. You get SGX_CHILD_PRESENT erro from EREMOVE.
2. In order to swap or fault a page you need to have an EPC page that
   holds a version number for the page you want to swap. These are
   called Version Array (VA) pages.
