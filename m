That would round down, not up. We got boards with 6GB VRAM as well and 
then need a 8GB BAR.

And the vram size won't fit into a long on 32bit systems. What I really 
need is order_base_2 for 64bit values.

But wait a second, thinking more about it we could do 
"order_base_2((real_vram_size >> 20) | 1)".

Yeah, and subtracted by 20. Thought about a better wording as well, but 
couldn't come up with something.

"size" is just what the spec uses. How about rbar_size to note that it 
is size as the meaning in the RBAR specification?

Nope, I actually thought about calling panic() here instead.

If we hit this we have messed things so badly up that we can't access 
the hardware any more, so no way to tell it to shut down or something 
like this.

Well, I could completely rewrite the call chain to signal modprobe that 
loading the driver didn't worked at all. But that comes pretty near to 
calling BUG_ON() as well.

Thanks for the comments,
Christian.
