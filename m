The problem with handling this in kernel is that there isn't an 
obviously correct policy. ACPI will typically only expose 16 or so 
backlight levels so the behaviour is easy enough, but (depending on how 
the hardware is wired up) i915 may expose around 20,000. Further, one 
machine may expose different backlight controls for different displays, 
and in that situation you need to know which one the input event is 
expected to correspond to.

Doing backlight control properly involves a lot of policy work, and I'm 
reluctant to argue that that ought to be in the kernel.
