Why should the userspace application, who just wants to lit a LED, have
to care about a lot of other sound cards and interfaces and mute them,
when the user does not care?

And what about multiseat setups? If a multiseat keyboard has a mic mute
LED, do you think another user's mic mute state should influence the LED
of your keyboard?
