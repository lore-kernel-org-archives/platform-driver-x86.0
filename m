Hi Lorenzo,

Apologies for the delay in response, I took some time and had another
look at your ACPI code, and the results make a lot more sense now.

Fan control was not added in v6.14, so it makes sense that the string is
not being logged.

This is a good sign that the firmware (and obviously the hardware) is
working fine.

This is perfectly reasonable. I observe similar jump in fan speeds on my
device as well.

I am sorry but I don't really have an answer for this. All I can say is
whatever the firmware is doing, it should be same in Windows and Linux.

I think you can give the most accurate answer here with physical
testing, but from what I can see, it looks like it acpi_fan is wired
correctly, it reads the 1-byte RPM state from EC (and multiplies by 100
to get the true RPM):

             Method (_FST, 0, NotSerialized)  // _FST: Fan Status
             {
                 TFST [0x02] = (\_SB.PCI0.LPC0.EC0.F1SP * 0x64)
                 Return (TFST) /* \_SB_.FAN0.TFST */
             }

I can't seem to find anything, but will be glad to know if someone else
can enlighten me here.

Yes, so here is what I found. All HPWMI_GM (command 0x20008) queries go
through WHCM, but the relevant switch-case does not call its dispatcher:

                         Case (0x00020008)
                         {
                             RTCD = RTCC /* \_SB_.WMID.RTCC */
                         }

Notice how it simply assigns RTCD, but does not call method GMCF. GMCF
is the universal dispatcher responsible for calling the appropriate
methods:

             Method (GMCF, 2, Serialized)
             {
                 Switch (Arg0)
                 {
                     Case (One)
                     {
                         RTCC = Zero
                         Return (GC01 ())
                     }
		    ...

This explains why despite stub methods being present, are not called,
and instead we get -22 (-EINVAL) as response.

Now about the AE_AML_OPERAND_TYPE error, in WHCM, if we see other
branches like HPWMI_READ:

                         Case (One)
                         {
                             If (((CMTP > Zero) && (CMTP <= 0x5C)))
                             {
                                 If ((DASI < DerefOf (RCDS [(CMTP - One)])))
                                 {
                                     RTCD = 0x05
                                 }
                                 Else
                                 {
                                     Local2 = RDCF (CMTP, Arg1)
                                     RTCD = RTCC /* \_SB_.WMID.RTCC */
                                 }
                             }
                         }

It assigns the response buffer object to Local2. This assignment from
the dispatcher is missing in case of HPWMI_GM queries. Later on, Local2
is being dereferenced:

                     RTCD = DerefOf (Local2 [Zero])
                     If ((RTCD == Zero))
                     {
                         If ((DerefOf (Local2 [One]) <= Local0))
                         {
                             Local0 = Zero
                             While ((Local0 < DerefOf (Local2 [One])))
			    ...

Which is usually fine, but when Local2 is undefined (as in case of
HPWMI_GM) it defaults to an Integer, which obviously cannot be
dereferenced, and must be responsible for AE_AML_OPERAND_TYPE.

TL;DR: ACPI code looks broken, not something I can fix from the driver
side. What I can (and probably should) do is, query for fan count (or
something similar) and conditionally disabled fan control (pwm1_enable,
fan{1,2}_input), that would likely stop the hwmon polling spam in dmesg.

PS: HPWMI_READ/HPWMI_WRITE commands are still valid. You should be able
to confirm this by, for example, reading thermal profile
(cat /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile) and AE_AML_OPERAND_TYPE errors
should not appear in dmesg.

PPS: If you are interested in the correct firmware, you can see the
acpidump attached in this[1] bugzilla issue. I am pasting diff of WHCM
for your reference.
