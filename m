Absolutely fine in IIO.

Sorry I took so long to reply. Read the title and expected more detailed issue so queued
 it up for when I had more time. Oops.

Only slight gotcha is that there is some debate over the iio timer trigger
 configuration interface which would be equivalent of a polled input device.

Hence it hasn't merged yet.
Comes down to how these are instantiated. Lars-Peter Clausen is planning a configfs
 proposal rather than how we do the user space trigger creation currently.

A user space trigger would work but then you loose lack of hitting sysfs files.
