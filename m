Looks like that binary MOF file has "well-known" file extension .bmf.=20
=46ile itself starts with magic hader "FOMB" which is in reverse BMOF=20
(binary mof). But I was not able to find any specification nor any other=20
details. As this binary format is dated back to Win9x I guess data would=20
compressed by some old MS compression algorithm (CAB?).

Moreover via tool wmiofck.exe it is possible to generate header file for=20
WMI driver from binary mof file:

  wmiofck.exe -hfile.h -m -u file.bmf

And what is interesting that in this file are also comments which looks=20
like comes from that binary mof file.

When I looked into output from mofcomp.exe with above args, that MOF=20
output did not contain comments, so looks like we still can miss=20
something.
