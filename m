I've looked at hp-wmi: the hotkey is indeed dispatched via WMI
(hp-wmi) so you need something in userspace (KDE, Gnome, etc) to
respond to that key press.

Ok, that's weird. 0 turns off the panel by design, 255 should not...

No idea what's going on here... might be some weird vendor magic.
The WMI code is rather obscure...
