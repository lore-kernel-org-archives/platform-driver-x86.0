Yes, the only real (or new) change here is the introduction of the IOCTL
"TOSHIBA_ACPI_SCI", which was added to circumvent buggy or "incomplete"
BIOSes found (so far) on TOS1900 devices.

Any new (or old) program that want to access the SMM can do so by pointing
their path to /dev/toshiba_acpi instead of /dev/toshiba, however, it is strongly
recommended to use the new IOCTL for any SCI command to avoid any buggy
BIOS.
