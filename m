It is not just the user that sets the brightness.

Still, if you're sure that all userspace users react only to the hotkey type
of event, removing the sysfs one won't break anything any further.

But it will be *really* annoying the day we revisit this because someone
started abusing the hotkey uevent and we have to deploy a proper fix (rate
limiting or switching to a proper event report interface that doesn't use
uevents).

Yeah, I know that bug quite well, thinkpads were the first victims of
idiotic feedback event loops caused by braindead userspace.
