I though about it and I already wrote that is it not practical. For ACPI
drivers there is easy way to get that interrupt number from ACPI tables.
From i2c-i801 PCI driver it is hard to get interrupt number for
particular ACPI device...

That is way I preferred simple solution: ACPI driver for ACPI device and
i2c driver for i2c device.
