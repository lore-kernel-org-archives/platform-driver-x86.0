I agree.  Probably it was a mistake to bring up this code here.
Let me try to go back two steps:  Could you please let me
know if there is any progress in mainlining the TI Dollar Cove PMIC
and related drivers?  Is there a schedule?
After waiting for four months I'm actually getting impatient
because by now the Cherryview based hardware seems to go out
of production and I fear the mainlining might never happen.

Thanks,
Johannes
