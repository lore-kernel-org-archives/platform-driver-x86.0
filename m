Thanks, Dmitry, for building the case for CMPC. Besides input devices,
classmate-laptop only supports a single rfkill device. Currently, using
the driver without rfkill support is possible. That's not the case when
the input subsystem is disabled. I would like the user to go the the
platform/x86 menu and say 'hey, classmate support'.

That would however, be an argument for using select for everything, or
making depends work just like some dependencies resolvers work in
package management systems, like apt. OTOH, that would imply in lots of
undesired questions when someone does not want to enable anything that
depends on USB (or any bus or subsystem) at all.

For the case of CMPC, the user has already entered the platform/x86
menu. The CMPC option will not be visible if INPUT has been disabled.
And select works just fine here, since INPUT does not depend on
anything. OTOH, INPUT can only be disabled if EMBEDDED is enabled. And
if the user has done that, user must know what user is doing. So, if the
rule of thumb is that major subsystems should not be selected, I'd be
willing to submit of ack a patch fixing that.

Regards,
Cascardo.
