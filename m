This entry appears wrong, or at least incomplete. My system boots with =
a
default value of 18, and the 'set' implementation accepts any value fro=
m
0 to 255.

According to the comments in dell-laptop.c, the value actually means
something different than on/off:

  cbArg3, byte0  Desired setting of ALS value that turns the light on o=
r off.

Admittedly, I'm not clear on what the intended interface is, as I've
never had the ALS / keyboard backlight controls all working properly on
my laptop in the first place, but I thought this would be the right
place to ask about getting the documentation and driver in sync.

NB: I came across this because

   (1) I'd really like to be able to turn the keyboard backlight on, th=
e
   timeout off, and the ALS off; and

   (2) I noticed there was a new driver patch in 3.19 (nice! thanks!),
   where previously there must have been some kind of half-functional
   working driver -- I could get backlight control, but it always timed
   out too quickly.

It seems like /sys/.../als_setting is documented to handle the latter
part of (1), but its implementation does not match.

Thanks,
Brian

P.S. The author of this page [1] might be interested in these new drive=

additions.
