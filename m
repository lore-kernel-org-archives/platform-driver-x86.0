Booting with all 24 CPUs and then offlining cpu16-23 via
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/online before suspending does NOT help: the
machine still never wakes. Only booting with nr_cpus=16 works. The CPUs 
have to never
be brought up at all.

cpu16-23 here are the second SMT thread of the eight Zen5c cores
(APIC ids 17,19..31). With nr_cpus=16 the kernel brings up every core's
primary thread plus only the four Zen5 siblings.

On the amd-s2idle report: I cannot produce one for the failing
configuration. The machine never resumes, so the script never gets to
write its output, and there is no pstore to recover it from.

Or did you mean to generate the report in the working nr_cpus=16 boot ?

also, I should explain that I am on a sysvinit system with no systemd, 
so the script's journal-based log collection will not work. Is there a 
dmesg or logfile fallback, or should I capture the kernel log separately 
and attach it?
