Ok, I asked for more feedback. Yes, TDP changes do work, but they are
not correct. Users AB testing with a Decky plugin called
SimpleDeckyTDP report major divergence.

SimpleDeckyTDP uses a combination of RyzenAdj for AMD and RAPL for
Intel. When set to 7W, users report 25W power consumption when using
the kernel driver and 15W when using simpledeckytdp on A8. 15W is the
correct value for a 7W envelope on an X840u APU.

STAPM should not be required to use or deviate from STT. Both of them
should have equivalent behavior and match ryzenadj as the underlying
DPTC hooks are the same, ryzenadj just accesses the mailbox directly.
Using STAPM is a workaround for buggy vendor firmware that does not
control boost values correctly (SPPT/FPPT) and is what the first
generation Lenovo Legion Go did as well before they fixed it.

STAPM as a workaround works because it uses timers to control boost
values, so they decay after 2-3 minutes to the steady state TDP set by
the firmware. STT boosts for as long as the device thermal envelope
allows. STAPM is deprecated by AMD, only STT should be used going
forward. +CC Mario

This points to a BIOS firmware issue. You should consider getting in
touch with your MSI contact for feedback and to plan a fix. I do not
have an MSI contact. And yes, I am not happy my users have to rely on
third party unvetted plugins for basic power controls.

But we cannot revisit this driver while basic behavior. does not work.
If MSI does not fix this or there isn't a bug in this driver we can
fix, the only viable way forward from our side is to move power
controls to the DPTC RFC driver/RAPL for affected models and only
retain fan curves on this driver. I do not want to do this, I have
userspace integration for this driver already, but it is not
functional to the standard expected by users.

I checked the ACPI firmware and unlike other manufacturers, there is
no EC independent control of the power envelope. We would still need
to check a low battery hook in firmware but other than that it is a
straight translation.
