It was in fact very fun to find out new commands, and I found interesti=
ng stuff.

However, I have a quick question: what does "wireless button" control
exactly ? Because my laptop (SwSmi@ one), seems to have a totally
different command to control rfkill (both for bluetooth and wlan). My
guess is that command do the same thing that happens when you press
the Fn+F12 key, but if it's really that I'd prefer use the "true"
rfkill interface with differencied control for bluetooth and wlan.

I have found other interesting information including:
- you can pass up to 11 byte of data for each command (but I didn't
found any command using more than 6)
- there is a way to find the model name and bios version near the signa=
ture
- wlan and bluetooth control
- USB charge control
- Keyboard backlight control
- Battery life extender control

I'll try to clean that up and send some patches in one week or two.
