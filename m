Thanks for pointing that out, I haven't heard of this tool before.
I'll give it a try before my next submission.

I agree there is a difference in the logic here, thanks for taking the
time to point it out so clearly, and sorry for missing this. But AFAIU
userspace should not call RFKILL_OP_CHANGE with ev.type =3D=3D
RFKILL_TYPE_ALL, as RFKILL_OP_CHANGE is intended to be used to
block/unblock one RFKill switch, and it is not possible to create a
RFKill switch with type =3D=3D RFKILL_TYPE_ALL (rfkill_alloc() would
return NULL).

I tried to look into the source code of the test suite you pointed,
but couldn't easily figure out how it ends up with that combination.
Could you please explain (or point me in the code) how is that a valid
operation? If I'm not missing anything, we should probably return
EINVAL in this case.

Regards,
