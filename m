Old Samsung laptops have the same issue, and I ended up patching
drivers/acpi/video_detect.c (check "[PATCH] ACPI / Video: blacklist
some samsung laptops").
Doing it in the vendor module is complicated, since, it will be loaded
after the acpi video module most of the time, and that means addding
acpi_backlight, then removing it, which will probably confuse
usespace.
Patching drivers/acpi/video_detect.c seems safer.
