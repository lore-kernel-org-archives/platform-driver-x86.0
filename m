Manual configuration is another option.

Why? Because you prefer autoconfiguration and all other people must use=20
it only? Does not seems a good argument.

=46or machine which does not change, static policy file is enough too. And=

for this simple case it will work correctly.

Why everybody must be forced to use some autoconfiguration and does not=20

I'm not saying that one script must be universal for everything. My=20
script is enough for machine with single keyboard led. And for other=20
people who have only one backlight keyboard it will work fine too.

=46or other cases something other could be written...

But does not have to be. If your own scripts are under your control then=20
you can use it race-free.

Value read *after* receiving poll notification. By poll notification we=20
know that brightness was changed. And to get new up-to-date value, new=20
read() must be done.

If value is changed again, you will receive another poll notification.

I do not see any race here. You will get poll notification about every=20
change, so what is the problem? You do not miss any change for sure.

You are not forced to use something. I'm proposing extending current ABI=20
which can be used for processes who want those notification.

If you do not want it, just do not use it.

Yes, somebody creates some right central daemon and everybody who want=20
to use LED kernel API will be forced to use that one "right" daemon?

And what happens if somebody write new daemon with new userspace ABI=20
just because that previous was incorrect/broken/does not fit all needs?

No kernel must not force which userspace application will be used for=20
some operation. This sounds like Microsoft product...
