It does, however, unfortunately, AFAK this 'device' is not listed in
any of those
ACPI tables. This is not even a real device, it's a CMOS chip with a fixed mem
segment and it needs dma only to let it read out the cmd data from a buffer.
So it's not really possible to support proper iommu for this driver.
Same is true for the previously mentioned drm915 mock test device.

Either way, there are device drivers which for various reasons may need to
opt-out / force 1:1 iommu mapping to work properly when iommu is turned on.

I agree that the current way of handling this (archdata.iommu) in intel_iommu
driver is not nice, a better solution might be to create a generalized way
through iommu.h (eg a method or constant value stored in main dev /
pdev struct),
which is well documented to be used only for legacy drivers / special
cases where
forced 1:1 mapping is truly justified / last resort. And other arch
iommu drivers can
support this, if and until necessary (legacy drivers don't need anymore).
