Then, let's not add this parameter. Anyway the potential user base who
may acer-wmi without this mode is probably very low.

But I still think that having a parameter to enable this "raw" mode
would be helpful in some case, for example, "the keycode changed and
is not yet mapped to KEY_WLAN", or "wimax is not yet supported by
acer-wmi and there is not (yet) a rfkill interface for it". This would
be a quirk mode, only enabled for some very special cases, like
acpi_osi=3D"Linux" or acpi_backlight=3D"vendor".
