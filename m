Yes it can, so I've already withdrawn my part of the proposal to move
all the quirks to acpi/video_detect.c since we will simply have to
learn to live with the ordering issues it seems. A solution for dealing
with the raw interface showing up later is discussed here:

Except for allowing to circumvent the acpi_osi_is_win8() check from
the cmdline / from dmi based quirks this will have 100% the same functionality
as today.

We really don't want this kind of blacklisting in user space, instead if
the interface is broken (or less functional then the alternative) we
should simply not register it at all.

Maybe if we were to redesign all this we would leave all this up to
userspace (so load no backlight driver at all, and let userspace pick one),
but that ship has sailed, so since we're determining what to do in kernel
space now, lets keep it in kernel space and not some crazy mix where
first kernel space does some quirks / blacklisting and then userspace
(depending on which DE also) adds its own magic. Lets not go there please.
