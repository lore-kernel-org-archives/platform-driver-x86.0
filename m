The acpi_backlight= is used to tell the ACPI video module and the
platform module, who should create a backlight control interface. Since
the two modules both use ACPI to do the backlight control, hence the acpi
prefix in the cmdline option(my personal explanation :-). The
video.use_native_backlight is introduced to solve Win8 problem and
involves the third interface, raw. I agree that the acpi_backlight= and
video.use_native_backlight is confusing, I prefer the
backlight=platform/firmware/raw cmdline option if we can get rid of the
legacy.

We shouldn't expose non-working interface from the kernel side, but if
they all work, I don't think we should hide them. The i915 driver always
creates its backlight control interface no matter what others did, I
think this is the right thing as long as it makes sure it's not exposing
a broken one. The vendor and video driver don't do things this way may
be that there is little chance they will work well at the same time.

What a mess...
I thought the WMI event could be stopped by calling some ACPI control
method and the vendor driver may already do this if it decides the
backlight control should be done by ACPI video. For the scancode and
video event, I thought it is the EC that does the decision - it should
either generate a scancode or sends out an ACPI notification to the
video output device and then have the video driver to send the event to
user space, but not both! But yes, things can go wrong and the worst
thing would be, a hotkey press gives three events as you have described.
I don't know the case for WMI, but the majority ECs seem to work OK in
this regard, i.e. it doesn't generate the two things but only one of them.

Thanks,
Aaron
