Actually, yes. The restart handlers are invoked in atomic context, but
the EC communication needs to block. (The 1.75 EC is actually a SPI
master: a command it initiated by poking a GPIO and waiting until EC
tells us it's ready to read a command.)

Sorry for not mentioning that earlier, I forgot that it is the case.
