Thinking about this some more, the mux(es) should be its own node(s).
Then the question is where to put the nodes.

Well, you should. Type-C connectors are certainly complicated enough
that we'll need one. Plus we already require connector nodes for
display outputs, so what do we do once you add display muxing?

Either you can have a vbus-supply property in connector node or it can
be implied that the controller chip provides that. For example, HDMI
connectors have a hpd-gpios property if HPD is connected to GPIO or
they have nothing and it's implicit that the HDMI encoder handles HPD.

Those should probably be elsewhere and not be fusb302 specific. I did
ack that, but it was a single node for a single component which is
fine. But once we start adding more external pieces we need to pay
more attention to the overall structure.

Things in DT should follow what the h/w design looks like which is not
necessarily aligned with the driver structure. If the USB PD chip
needs information from the charger, then we need a kernel interface
for that.

My concern here is not so much this binding in particular, but rather
that we handle Type-C connectors in a common way and not adhoc with
each platform doing things their own way. Otherwise, we end up with a
mess of platform specific bindings like charger/battery bindings
(though there's some work improving those).
