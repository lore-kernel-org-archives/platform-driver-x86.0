Hmm so can this also be used for the USB gadget subsystem
to tell charge controller when it's OK to enable 500mA
charging after enumeration?

FYI, that's controlled by the bq24190 pin named OTG that should
be only set high after enumeration. Any ideas how that is wired
on your device? Does it connect to the USB PHY or to a GPIO
line?
