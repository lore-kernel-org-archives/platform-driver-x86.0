If we're using a different interface to Windows then we're still doing 
it wrong. I'll take patches that port us to the interface that's 
actually being used, but I won't take patches that just try to cover up 
a broken interface that the vendor doesn't test.

If Windows uses this interface on Latitude and Vostro then I'll do that, 
but otherwise no.
