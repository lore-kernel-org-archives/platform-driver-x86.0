At least for this I can foresee at least one more user in the
pipeline, encrypted memory support for persistent memory mappings that
will store the key-id in the ptes.

I'm ok with passing it the same way as altmap or a new
arch_add_memory_prot() my only hangup with after the fact changes is
the wasted effort it inflicts in the init path for potentially large
address ranges.
