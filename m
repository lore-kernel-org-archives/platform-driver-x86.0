Hi All,

Here is v2 of my rewrite / cleanup of the acpi-video (and platform/x86)
backlight interface selection logic.

The major change in v2 of this set are 2 changes to the patch titled
"acpi-video-detect: video: Make video_detect code part of the video module":

1) The __setup call for the acpi_backlight= handling is moved to
   acpi/util.c as __setup may only be used by code which is always builtin
2) video.c is renamed to acpi_video.c so that it can be combined with
   video_detect.c into video.ko

These 2 changes result in the backlight kernel commandline options after this
patch-set being 100% compatible with the old options, with the exception of
the removal of the video.use_native_backlight option as that now is folded
into acpi_backlight=[video|vendor|native|none] rather then having 2 options
which influence each other in interesting ways.

Besides that there is a small change to the dell-laptop port to the new API
removing an unnecessary #ifdef ACPI.

Regards,

Hans
