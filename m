Did you mean "(...) we'll want subdrivers to get references to (...)"
(without the first "to")?

Is there any specific reason for splitting device_unregister() into two
separate calls it performs?

This kfree() obviously wasn't introduced by you, but I believe that
after patch 06 from this series is applied, this branch cannot be
reached any more.  If I understand correctly, it could only be reached
(using code without this patch series applied) when duplicate GUIDs wer=
e
present, for which a struct wmi_block was allocated and added to
wmi_block_list, but for which wmi_create_device() wasn't called.  Patch
06 prevents a struct wmi_block from ever being allocated for duplicate
GUIDs and this patch ensures that even if device_add() fails for some
reason, the relevant struct wmi_block is removed from wmi_block_list an=
d
freed anyway.  I also don't see any way for a struct wmi_block to be
inserted into wmi_block_list without both wmi_create_device() (so
device_initialize()) and device_add() being called.  So perhaps this
kfree() call (and the relevant conditional expression) could be removed
in another patch?

Perhaps this label and the kfree() call should be moved closer to the
return statement below to avoid confusion?  If obj is not a buffer then
no new struct wmi_block(s) will be added to wmi_block_list, so there is
little point in iterating over the latter below.

A put_device(&wblock->dev.dev) is missing here.  If we don't do that,
the reference count for wblock->dev.dev will still be at 1 due to
device_initialize() being called before and we will leak wblock.

I have one more minor issue with error handling for device_add().  A bi=
t
earlier, in the GUID-processing loop, there's this snippet:

	if (debug_event) {
		wblock->handler =3D wmi_notify_debug;
		wmi_method_enable(wblock, 1);
	}

So we should probably put:

	if (debug_event)
		wmi_method_enable(wblock, 0);

before the put_device() call I mentioned above.
