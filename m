Yes, the Function keys look the same:-

I went with KEY_FILE on the USB keyboard, since this is what it's mapped 
to on the Bluetooth keyboard, as part of the CONSUMER usage page:-
http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/drivers/hid/hid-input.c#L694

Personally I've no fondness to what the keys map to, since I remap them to 
how they are labelled on an Thinkpad X230, which is pause/nexttrack. 
However, it seems somewhat silly customising something that appears to be 
a standard mapping.

That's true. It works fine with Fn-ESC but yes, on these keyboards they 
are labelled such that F11 is the Fn-modified version.

I think there are also some Apple keyboards using the same symbols, it 
might be worth seeing if these are supported and what they produce.
