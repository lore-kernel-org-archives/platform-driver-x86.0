These patches fix the iTCO watchdog for Apollo Lake.
I changed the watchdog memory io to only use 4 bytes rather
the whole region, I'm not sure if that is the correct way.

The previous 0x30h offset in intel_pmc_ipc.c was for based
on the earlier BXT-M platform. Apollo Lake has it at 0x40h.

Let me know if the patches need changes.
Please CC me as I am not subscribed, thanks.

* Resent, typo in linux-kernel email address

Changes since v1:
	* Watchdog NO_REBOOT bit off-by-one corrected.
