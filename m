I was thinking about exporting some dell_wmi_notifier_register and
unregister functions (based on atomic_notifier_chain_register) from
dell-wmi. And dell-laptop could use it. Something similar is already
implemented in dell-rbtn+dell-latop, but still I'm consider it as hack.

This one in dell-wmi could be easier as dell-rbtn because dell-wmi is
monolitic. dell-wmi could be loaded only on systems which support it, so
at that register call (from dell-laptop) you already know if you receive
events or not.
