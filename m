Oh, then in this case it may be that your device needs to be put in a
special mode, and the report descriptors will show us some hints on
how to do it (maybe).
I strongly doubt that USB is in fault here. I can not see any reasons
why the USB or underlying driver would select which packets are
transmitted.

What you can also do is setup a windows virtual machine, assign the
usb device to it, and sniff through usbmon or wireshark what packets
are emitted from/to the mouse. Then, we will duplicate this behavior
in the hid driver, and you would be good to go. Still, having the
reports descriptors (which are provided by hid-recorder, or in
/sys/kernel/debug/hid/DEVICE/rdesc, or in lsusb -vv when the usbhid
driver is not bound) would help us to understand the mouse firmware.

Cheers,
Benjamin
