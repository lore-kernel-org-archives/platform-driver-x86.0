I think you mean or, not and, depending on a module option the
code should do either 1) or 2) not both :)

Darren, Andy could you live with a module option for this?

Ack, although 2 will require some work in userspace, teach
all the layers like xkb about the new KEY_KBDILLUMCYCLE and
teach g-s-d to listen to it and do the right thing. But long
term 2. is the correct solution, so it would be good to start
working towards this.

I would just use 1. for Xorg compat and not bother with this mess.
