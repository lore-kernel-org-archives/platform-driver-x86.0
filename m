My 2 cents: sound subsystem needs to match exactly against instance 
since we (must) know how each component are wired in HW. For instance 
nothing prevents to have multiple audio codec chips with the same HID.

There are couple examples under sound/soc/intel where system have 
multiple codecs with the same HID.

(I don't know do we have yet a better way in ACPI to describe audio HW 
than matching know instances and tying them together with a code).
