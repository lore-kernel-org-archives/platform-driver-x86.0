Hi All,

Here is v5 of my patch-set for my i2c-core improvements for acpi
devices + the ACPI INT33FE platform driver.

New in this version are some minor fixed to the INT33FE driver.

The INT33FE driver depends on the i2c-core changes, so if
it is ok with Darren / Andy I believe it would be best for
this driver to be merged through the i2c subsys tree (with
their ack).

Regards,

Hans
