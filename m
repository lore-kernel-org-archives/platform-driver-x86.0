But approach with exporting new sysfs file with name current_brightness=20
with existence of old brightness sysfs file is not good and in my=20
opinion it is even worst as current situation (=3D without poll support).

What happen in next 5 years? Somebody point that sysfs file "brightness"=20
and sysfs file "current_brightness" is still not good and invent=20
"really_current_brightness" sysfs with new logic? No this is really not=20
a way...

I understand that extending current "brightness" sysfs is complicated,=20
but it is not a reason to not doing it and inventing new crippling sysfs=20
file which duplicate existing one (with some modifications).

Anyway, I cannot believe that power usage is increased by factor 5 with=20
exporting poll support. If we are going to change brightness level=20
(either by trigger or timer) we still need to do wakeup.

And we can do some optimizations, e.g. do not send poll event when=20
nobody is listening or postpone event so we do not send too many events=20
in 1s interval (or choose longer interval).

Polling support is not in mainline kernel yet, so we can change its=20
behaviour without breaking ABI. And we can define (if it help us!) that=20
evens can be send to userspace with some delay (e.g. 1-3s).
