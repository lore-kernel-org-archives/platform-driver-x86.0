Not really, but I agree it's not ideal. If there's a mechanism to get 
the system temperature via WMI then you could easily construct your own 
thermal zone and associated cooling device, but otherwise you'd have to 
provide a mechanism for exporting either the CPU information from 
coretemp or the thermal zones from ACPI.

I'm sorry, you're right - you're calling ACPI methods directly instead. 
This is still incorrect. The platform provides an exported interface, 
and you should use that exported interface.

As long as Corentin doesn't object, I'm happy to merge this driver in 
its current form (including virt_to_phys()) providing that it's wrapped 
in CONFIG_STAGING, and assuming that you'll do the supporting work in 
acpica. I'll pull it out again in 6 months or so if that hasn't been 
fixed up. Fair?
