Humm, that's not how the mux binding works. The mux controller is what
drives the mux select lines and is the provider. The consumer is the
mux device itself. What decides the mux state is determined by what
you are muxing, not which node has mux-controls property.

By putting mux-controls in fusb302 node, you are saying fusb302 is a
mux (or contains a mux).

Well this is a new one (maybe, I suppose others have sneaked by). If
ACPI folks want to use DT bindings, then what do I care. But I have no
interest in reviewing ACPI properties. The whole notion of sharing
bindings between DT and ACPI beyond anything trivial is flawed IMO.
The ptifalls have been discussed multiple times before, so I'm not
going to repeat them here.

Just as the fusb302 can have board specific properties, so can a charger IC.

Then don't document this stuff as DT bindings when it is not really.
