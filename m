Changes since V2:
	- use 'struct device' instead of raw kobject to represent
	  RAPL domains
	- changed eventfd control interface to use event string
	  instead of passing file descriptors that cannot be
	  authenticated in sysfs directory
	- clean ups based on v1 reviews
		- use kcalloc for arrays
		- drop dependencies on X86
		- misc cleanups

I don have a checkpatch error which I think it is not valid. I can
fix it by avoiding the macro/adding more lines.

ERROR: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parenthesis
#735: FILE: platform/x86/intel_rapl.c:735:
+#define RO_PRIMITIVE(name)						\
+	primitive_show_fn(name)						\
+	static DEVICE_ATTR(name, S_IRUGO, show_##name, NULL)

If i put parenthesis around it to mute the error then it won't compile.

I attempted to come up with a simple version as Greg suggested to
just expose cooling device but then I realized we could lose many
key functionalities partially due to the correlations among RAPL
control knobs. I am still working on this since it is not as simple as
deleting the advanced interfaces, I would have to do some setup based
on best guesses.
