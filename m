Here is what the driver does with the patch:
- automatically load the driver and each machine with vendor =
"SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD." and type looks like a laptop or
netbook
- map the f0000 segment (or exit gracefully)
- find SwSMI or SECLINUX in this segment (or exit gracefully)

At this point, if the driver is still loaded, but the laptop doesn't
support SABI, then it really looks like a model that should be
blacklisted.
I'm ok to use dmi for quirks, or blacklist, but honestly if a *samsung
laptop* advertise SABI support, the driver should be loaded.
We can't prevent samsung to built a laptop that will burn if we use
SABI, but if samsung does that, they can also add some fake DMI
strings too ! And has I said in the changelog, all models supported by
samsung-q10 are not affected because they don't use the same vendor
string, and even if they were, I doubt we would found a valid
signature.

But yes, it needs testing, so if you know a samsung laptop user,
please ask him to test this patch.

I set up a git repo that can help to build the driver more easilly:
https://github.com/iksaif/samsung-laptop-dkms (yeah, it's named dkms,
but there is no dkms.conf yet, that will come later).

For those, boot with acpi_backlight=vendor  :)
