Exactly same as it is doing desktop. It is possible to 100% reimplement
desktop logic for identification of keyboard backlight LED

Yes and script can be adjusted to use specific one (config option for
script).

This is reason why poll() is needed. So desktop GUI will receive
information that somebody else changed LED.

Hm? Why should be this a problem? Anyway you can chmod brightness
attribute... But this "root need" is not a problem.

Also your script can be spawned by some udev rule or some other program
which detect e.g. power supply connection/disconnection.

Sometime there does not have to be any desktop loaded. It could but it
does not have to be.

Look at TLP scripts. They are very popular, and they have no problems
with 1) (needs proper configuration) 2) (fixed by 1) 3) (no visible
problem) 4) (spawned by root udev daemon or manually as root).

And probably every desktop will use own different method like before. No
thanks. I do not want to depend on particular desktop or implement
zillions of different desktop APIs. And even depend on desktop.

If I think about addition to TLP scripts they should work also without
running desktop...

One script can set 3 LEDs too. I do not see any problem here.

That is something different. For automatic configuration of LEDs some
running daemon is needed. But for manual and static configuration it is
not needed. So depends on what you want...
