This series adds display switching support for Apple laptops. The first
two patches contain preparatory changes to vga_switcheroo, and the third
contains the changes to support display switching with the gmux.

While these patches will allow switching the display mux, most Macbook
owners will not be able to switch GPUs in practice until the graphics
drivers are updated to deal with missing or incorrect vbios information
on Apple machines. These patches do fix an issue seen by some users of
Linux on Macbooks, however. These users will switch to the internal GPU
in OS X and then reboot into Linux to save power, but after S3 the gmux
gets reset to the discrete GPU. Adding the display mux support will fix
this problem by restoring the gmux state during resume.

v2: Disable interrupts during suspend and re-enable them during resume
    to fix timeouts waiting for switching to complete after S3

Thanks,
Seth
