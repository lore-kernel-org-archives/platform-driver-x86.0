It shouldn't even be a dbus send - something in userspace should just be 
listening for event notifications on the accelerometer. Use udev 
directly.

acpid is for dealing with cases where the kernel doesn't provide 
functionality that the kernel should provide. Arbitrary APCI events 
shouldn't be being delivered to userspace - they should be handled 
in-kernel and delivered through a meaningful mechanism in order to avoid 
cases where userspace needs to know about a platform implementation. In 
this case the right way for the event to hit userspace is as a generic 
message from the accelerometer, not as a device-specific ACPI event 
through a deprecated interface.
