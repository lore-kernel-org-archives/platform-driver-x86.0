I am happy to take the set, however I think v4.12 is an unlikely
candidate, since there still have quite a few patches which are yet to
receive review and the merge-window opens in 6 days.

Once we have all the required Acks, I'll push the set into -next where
it can sit for a good soak test until v4.13.
