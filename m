I looked at display again and 0 only turn backlight off (or=20
adjust minimum value). If I look at display correctly (in dark=20
room) I can recognize that display is still on and I can see=20
window manager decorations (but text is not readable).

Value 255 when ALS is on has same effect as 0 - adjust minimum=20
value (instead maximum).
