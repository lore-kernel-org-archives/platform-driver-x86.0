This patch series moves the dell-led driver from the LED subsystem to
the x86 platform driver subsystem.  I decided to also CC the sound
subsystem contacts for the whole series as
sound/pci/hda/dell_wmi_helper.c is also affected.

The original motivation behind this effort was to move all code using
the dell-smbios module to the x86 platform driver subsystem.  While I
was investigating the possibilites to do that, it quickly emerged that
dell-led can and in fact should be moved to the x86 platform driver
subsystem in its entirety.

dell-led consists of two major parts:

  - the part exposing a microphone mute LED interface, introduced in
    db6d8cc ("dell-led: add mic mute led interface"); this interface is
    used by sound/pci/hda/dell_wmi_helper.c; while the original
    implementation used a WMI interface, it was changed to use
    dell-smbios in cf0d7ea ("dell-led: use dell_smbios_find_token() for
    finding mic DMI tokens") and 0c41a08 ("dell-led: use
    dell_smbios_send_request() for performing SMBIOS calls"),

  - the part handling an activity LED present in Dell Latitude 2100
    netbooks, introduced in 72dcd8d ("leds: Add Dell Business Class
    Netbook LED driver"); it binds to a specific WMI GUID and then
    registers a LED device which is controlled using WMI (i.e. it is
    basically a WMI driver).

Patches 1-4 clean up the microphone mute LED interface to minimize the
amount of code moved around.
  
Patch 5 moves the microphone mute LED interface to
drivers/platform/x86/dell-laptop.c, effectively causing
sound/pci/hda/dell_wmi_helper.c to depend on CONFIG_DELL_LAPTOP instead
of CONFIG_LEDS_DELL_NETBOOKS.
    
Patch 6 reverts dell-led to the state it was in after its initial commit
72dcd8d ("leds: Add Dell Business Class Netbook LED driver") by removing
all remnants of the microphone mute LED handling code.

Patch 7 moves all that is left of dell-led (i.e. the activity LED part,
as originally implemented), to a new module which is placed in
drivers/platform/x86/dell-wmi-led.c.

This patch series is based on linux-leds/for-4.11 as the LED subsystem
is affected by all patches except patch 3.

If anyone reading this has access to a Dell device which has an activity
LED and/or a microphone mute LED currently supported by dell-led, I
would love to hear from you as I do not have the hardware needed to
practically test this patch series.
