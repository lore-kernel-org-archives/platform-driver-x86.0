I actually don't think Corentin's solution is a bad one. It does suffer
from a couple of shortcomings though. First, it only works for broken
ACPI backlights, and some platforms have other backlight interfaces that
are broken (e.g. the i915 backlight on the MacBook Pro 8,2). Second,
marking backlights as broken in the kernel necessitates ever-expanding
dmi blacklists in some of the platform drivers, unless we can get
vendors to stop providing broken backlight interfaces.

I'm all for fixing integration bugs in the ACPI backlight
implementations if we can, but some vendor implementations are just
flat-out broken, and it isn't always possible to get vendor cooperation.
In the case of Toshiba I've tried reaching out to them to work on ACPI
integration issues, but they flat out refused.
