Indeed, you're right here.  The line is just barely over 80 characters
anyway, so it really doesn't matter here.

That was just a warning about you moving drivers/acpi/battery.h to
include/acpi/battery.h, which could potentially lead to an edit to
MAINTAINERS being neccessary.  I just double-checked this and the
include/acpi/ path was already listed in the MAINTAINERS file, so you're
good.
