I see. I guess I'd rather people reported the issue and we provided the
fix that have them work around the issue (maybe) and we never hearing
about it. This way fix hapepns quicker and work for everyone instead of
only the person discovered the magic option.

I think we discussed it enough, I'll defer to Matthew whether to take
the patch with the switch or the one enabling the mode unconditionally.

Thanks.
