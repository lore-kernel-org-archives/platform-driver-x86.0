Well, conventional way to solve this is to simply name the led
"acer::airplane"... that way it is persistent. We already do that for
display/keyboard backlights.

Take a look at the blinking triggers.

So... the LED changes meaning during boot? That's surely not a nice
solution.

So... you rather store bit in a kernel with unclear semantics,
explaining "oh I need to leave the flexibility to userland"? Sorry,
that's just ugly.

New LED trigger and new ioctl for LED control... not matching how LEDs
are normally controlled.
