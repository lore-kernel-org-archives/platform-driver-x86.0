The rfkill_sync_work syncs with rfkill_global_states, which is set duri=
ng=20
intitialization or by rfkill_switch_all, if I read it correctly. This s=
hould=20
be independent to acer-bluetooth state. The rfkill_global_states[BLUETO=
OTH]=20
should be unblocked initially, I need to verify it.

There is some magic in rfkill/input.c that plays with global states, bu=
t I=20
don't know if or how that one is used in my case.

I didn't have time to look at the problem more deeply to identify who i=
s=20
setting the global state to "blocked" or what really happens. Anyway, I=
 did=20
some testing with pressing the HW bluetooth switch and I saw the follow=
ing=20
immediately _after_ pressing the HW switch to enable bluetooth:

oldium ~ # rfkill list
0: acer-wireless: Wireless LAN
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
1: acer-bluetooth: Bluetooth
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
2: acer-threeg: Wireless WAN
        Soft blocked: yes
        Hard blocked: no
3: phy0: Wireless LAN
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no

I had this output 3 times immediately after each other. I'm using keybo=
ard=20
"up" and "enter" to repeat the last shell command, so this is a relativ=
ely=20
slow operation. So the state when the acer-bluetooth was unblocked stay=
ed for=20
relatively long time before hci0 appeared in rfkill. Afterwards I saw:

oldium ~ # rfkill list
0: acer-wireless: Wireless LAN
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
1: acer-bluetooth: Bluetooth
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
2: acer-threeg: Wireless WAN
        Soft blocked: yes
        Hard blocked: no
3: phy0: Wireless LAN
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
5: hci0: Bluetooth
        Soft blocked: yes
        Hard blocked: no

So it looks like the hci0 went blocked even when the acer-bluetooth swi=
tch was=20
unblocked. So it looks like the hci0 state is independent on the initia=
l acer-
bluetooth state.

Hopefully I have some time this evening (CET timezone) to add some stac=
k=20
traces and logs to see what really happens on my system.

Old=C5=99ich.
