Okay, I didn't consider the defaults.

Maybe we should talk about step by step getting away from these defaults
(perhaps move them to the defconfigs ?) on a broader scale ... but yeah,
that's far out of scope now.

So, you've conviced me.
Add me to Reviewed-By to your patches and forget about mine.

hmm, if circular deps happen, wouldn't that mean we've got some deeper
problems in here ? IMHO, dependencies should always form a DAG (except
for some really rare cases).

Do you recall any actual problem w/ input vs gpio vs. drivers ?
I'd like to have a closer look at it.

Well, this has the unpleasant side effect that we often have to enable
a lot of things, just to even see the individual driver. For people who
just wanna configure a kernel for their board, this is a bit nasty.

But, okay, I'm going to do this w/ my own tool - I've written a small
tool that allows easy kernel reconfiguration on a higher level: you
can just pick some board templates and enable high level features like
eth, gpu, etc - it automatically creates a .config for you. I'm going
announce it on lkml soon.
