the reason I'm asking is because from the DSDT the only reason why the
calls to setting backlight would not work are due to
	If (LEqual (^IGPU.PBCC, One))
	{
and PBCC is defined in PCI_Config space (should be set by the video
driver or something like that?)
	Device (IGPU)
	{
	    Name (_ADR, Zero)
	    OperationRegion (GPPB, PCI_Config, 0xB4, 0x14)
	    Field (GPPB, ByteAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
	    {
		PBCI,   8,
		PBNP,   8,
		PBLS,   8,
		PBCC,   8,
		PBCM,   32,
		PBDI,   32,
		PBDO,   32,
		PBMX,   32
	    }
Can you also switch to the second video card (do you have one) and try
if brightness regulation works?

Thanks
