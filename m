I don't object to export ec_handle, but thinkpad_acpi.c should get
adjusted as well.

I had a closer look and can come up with a replacement for acpi_get_devices
using bus.c matching function bus_find_device() avoiding the namespace
walk.

What do you think about this one?
I found these occurences of acpi_get_devices, which I would
adjust in follow up patches if it's worth it:
drivers/char/agp/hp-agp.c:      acpi_get_devices("HWP0003", zx1_gart_probe, "HWP0003", NULL);
drivers/char/agp/hp-agp.c:      acpi_get_devices("HWP0007", zx1_gart_probe, "HWP0007", NULL);
drivers/acpi/processor_core.c:  acpi_get_devices("ACPI0007", early_init_pdc, NULL, NULL);
drivers/platform/x86/eeepc-wmi.c:       status = acpi_get_devices(EEEPC_ACPI_HID, eeepc_wmi_parse_device,
drivers/platform/x86/thinkpad_acpi.c:   status = acpi_get_devices(hid, tpacpi_acpi_handle_locate_callback,


Argh, these are called before ACPI objects are initialized
(or parsed at all) and won't work:
drivers/acpi/ec.c:      status = acpi_get_devices(ec_device_ids[0].id, ec_parse_device,
arch/ia64/kernel/acpi.c:        acpi_get_devices(NULL, acpi_map_iosapic, NULL, NULL);
drivers/pnp/pnpacpi/core.c:     acpi_get_devices(NULL, pnpacpi_add_device_handler, NULL, NULL);
arch/x86/pci/mmconfig-shared.c: acpi_get_devices("PNP0C01", find_mboard_resource, &mcfg_res, NULL);
arch/x86/pci/mmconfig-shared.c:         acpi_get_devices("PNP0C02", find_mboard_resource, &mcfg_res,
arch/ia64/sn/kernel/io_acpi_init.c:     acpi_get_devices("SGIHUB", sn_acpi_hubdev_init, NULL, NULL);
arch/ia64/sn/kernel/io_acpi_init.c:     acpi_get_devices("SGITIO", sn_acpi_hubdev_init, NULL, NULL);

Looks like it's not worth it.
I paste my patch anyway, if there is any use-case,
it's already tested and works...:

ACPI: Provide an acpi device search on acpi bus registered devices

These should replace unnecessary acpi_get_devices invokations
which ends in a namespace walk.
