The Linux kernel tree currently contains two Dell laptop-related driver=
s
issuing SMBIOS requests in different ways (dell-laptop in
drivers/platform/x86 and dell-led in drivers/led).  As an upcoming patc=
h
series for the dell-wmi driver (also in drivers/platform/x86) will
change it so that it also performs SMBIOS requests, I took the
opportunity to unify the API used for issuing Dell SMBIOS requests
throughout the kernel before any further code duplication happens.
Credit for suggesting this goes to Pali Roh=C3=A1r.

This patch series is primarily intended for the platform-x86 subsystem,
with only 2 final patches touching the LED subsystem.

The first patch generates a lot of checkpatch warnings, but these are
also raised for the original code and I decided that not changing the
code while moving around large quantities of it is critical for
reviewability.

Changes from v1:

  - the SMBIOS buffer is no longer exported from the new dell-smbios
    module (patch 03 from v1 has been dropped, patches 08-09 from v2
    implement this change),

  - dell_smbios_send_request() is changed so that it doesn't return an
    SMBIOS buffer (patch 07 from v2),

  - slight patch reordering.

Note:

    In this series (both v1 and v2) I tried to stick to the overall
    concept used in dell-laptop, but in the v1 thread me and Pali also
    briefly discussed his alternative ideas [1][2] as to what this API
    could look like, so feel free to suggest a different approach.
