Because there is no point to have a module loaded when there is none
client to serve.

I can admit that's not a big deal, just making logic slightly more robust.

That's what I have in mind.

On the other hand it makes code more readable. With offsetof() it is a
bit hard to get it on the first glance.

Ah, because > is used usually is a quoting character in email you
missed the point.
It was written as >= 0.
