[ Very shortly after sending out an email about how most developers 
  probably don't end up reading much of lkml, and thus having missed all 
  the other threads on this subject ]

Everybody repeat after me: "After -rc2 I won't be taking patches or pull 
requests that aren't regression fixes or fixes to major bugs (oopses or 
security etc)".

See the -rc2 announcement, or any of (by now) roughly ten different 
threads on lkml and a couple of other mailing lists as response to pull 
requests etc ;^)

And yes, that very much does include new drivers. Especially if they end 
up affecting anything else (but in al honesty, I probably wouldn't take it 
now even if it was entirely standalone).
