It is typically handled by ACPI but it requires some hardware as well.
Looks like your machine does not use SCIs at all but instead events are
triggered using GPIO signals instead of GPEs.

Yes, it is that one and it triggers \_SB.GPO0._E4E() method to be called
whenever low edge is detected on the GPIO line. This method then handles
many things depending on what the AML code reads from ^^PCI0.I2C1.ENID
notifying the power button device (PWRB) among other things.

I suppose you already have CONFIG_ACPI_I2C_OPREGION=y in your .config?
That allows the AML code to access the I2C bus using the I2C driver.

Yeah, it uses control method power button (PNP0C0C) and ACPI GPIO event
to trigger changes in that.

Please check that you have that CONFIG_ACPI_I2C_OPREGION=y and
CONFIG_MFD_AXP20X=y.

You should see the ACPI:Event interrupt count increasing in
/proc/interrups when you press power button. When that works then we can
start thinking about adding wake support :)
