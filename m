Well, either we have userspace that rely on the uevents, or we don't. 

If we don't have any uevent users of the backlight notifications, we might
as well just rip out the feature entirely and replace it with something with
a proper design.  But that would mean all OSD is being done by time-based
open-read-close polling of sysfs or keyed to input events (and therefore
half-baked).

However, if we do have anything that rely on the uevents, it needs
BACKLIGHT_UPDATE_SYSFS.  Without it, there will be no notifications when the
backlight level is changed through sysfs.  And we *DO* have applications
that change the backlight level through sysfs.  From the top of my head, I
know KDE does when it starts, and also as a response to power management
events.  Also, userspace hotkey daemons do use the sysfs interface.
