You can try to put kernel parameter:

        acpi_osi=3D"!Windows 2009"

to /boot/grub/menu.lst, then reboot look at maybe better.

And,=20
could you please kindly share DSDT and dmidecode to me?
Plesae login by root then:
        % acpidump > acpidump.dat
        % dmidecode > dmidecode.log


Thanks a lot!
