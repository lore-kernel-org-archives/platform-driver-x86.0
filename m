Start reading around here

(and the earlier threads on the ALS class which Linus rejected)

I'd like to see an ALS class but it seems the head penguin won't accept
one, so we now have a zillion incompatible light sensors mostly out of
tree because nobody can be bothered to have the argument again.

The longer term plan is to stick all kinds of device sensors (as distinct
from input devices) into the IIO layer but that is still in staging and
seems to have no clear plan of date for migration yet. However Jonathan
(the maintainer) also doesn't seem too keen on owning them either

All in all ALS is a bit of a disaster area.
