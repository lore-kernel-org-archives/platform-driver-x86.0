Hello!

This is a third spin of the patch set that adds support for the Embedded
Controller on an OLPC XO 1.75 machine.

The previous patch set got feedback from Darren Hart, Sebastian Reichel a=
nd
Andy Shevchenko which I'm very thankful for. It hopefully incorporates fi=
xes
for all issues that were pointed out. Details in individual patches.

Tested to work on an OLPC XO 1.75 and also tested not to break x86
support with an OLPC XO 1 machine. I don't have a XO 1.5, but it's
unlikely this breaks it when XO 1 works.

Thank you
Lubo
