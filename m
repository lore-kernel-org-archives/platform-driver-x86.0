There are entirely legitimate use cases for using this as an
unprivileged user. However, that'll be up to system and distribution
policy, which can evolve over time, and it makes sense for the *initial*
kernel permission to start out root-only and then adjust permissions via
udev.

Building a software certificate store. Hardening key-agent software like
ssh-agent or gpg-agent. Building a challenge-response authentication
system. Providing more assurance that your server infrastructure is
uncompromised. Offloading computation to a system without having to
fully trust that system.

As one of many possibilities, imagine a distcc that didn't have to trust
the compile nodes. The compile nodes could fail to return results at
all, but they couldn't alter the results.
