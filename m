That was our first attempt at this, but because the brightness may also
be changed by triggers / blink-timers, we need to wakeup poll() in those
cases too (anything else would be inconsistent) and doing such a wakeup
in that case has turned out to cause too much overhead in some cases
(even if userspace is not listening), specifically the idle power uses
on some systems got multiplied by a factor of 5 or more.

So this approach was rejected.

This has already been discussed and the third patch in the set, which is
the one making the trigger read-only has been dropped.
