Henrique,

Thanks for the feedback. I had considered rejecting the patch for the reason you
describe, but opted to take it this time. I haven't established all my
maintainer policies yet, so they will change a little over time as we find what
works and what causes us more pain. Personally, I like to see the cleanups, but
generally agree that cleanups should typically be [PATCH 1/X] of a series.

Thanks,
