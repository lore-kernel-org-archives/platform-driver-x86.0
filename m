No. dell-smo8800 reads from ACPI irq number and exports /dev/freefall=20
device which notify userspace about falls. lis3lv02d is i2c driver which=20
exports axes of accelerometer. Additionaly lis3lv02d can export also=20
/dev/freefall if registerer of i2c device provides irq number -- which=20
is not case of this patch.

So both drivers are doing different things and both are useful.

IIRC both dell-smo8800 and lis3lv02d represent one HW device (that ST=20
microelectronics accelerometer) but due to complicated HW abstraction=20
and layers on Dell laptops it is handled by two drivers, one ACPI and=20
one i2c.

Yes, in ideal world irq number should be passed to lis3lv02d driver and=20
that would export whole device (with /dev/freefall too), but due to HW=20
abstraction it is too much complicated...

Ok, I will fix it in next patch iteration.

Yes, but I do not know how to fix it. Splitting message into two lines=20
generates warning. Having long line generates warning too.

Hm... That means your notebook has ST microelectronics accelerometer=20
too. You could try to find it on i2c-i801 bus with userspace i2cdetect=20
program (part of i2c-tools) and get i2c address. If it will work we can=20
extend DMI name --> i2c address mapping and include your notebook too.

I have that list of confirmed Latitude devices since April 2015 but due=20
to problem with ACPI resource conflicts it was not possible to load i2c-
i801.ko bus driver. It was fixed only this year by commit a7ae81952cda.=20
So list of devices is probably not up-to-date and new appeared.
