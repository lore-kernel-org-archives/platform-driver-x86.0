When you are saying that Pro 4 and later models use different
notifications, does this mean that Pro 4 does not define any GPIOs? If
so can we use their presence as indicator whether we should be using
this driver or not. I would like to avoid repeating the ACPI parsing
code that you have in the platform driver.

I do not believe -EAGAIN has any special meaning in the driver core;
also when the GPIO controller is not ready gpiod_get() will return
-EPROBE_DEFER, which is the prober way if signalling that some resource
is not yet available and probe should be retries at a later time.

Moreover, I do not believe that gpiod_count() needs GPIO controller to
be ready, the count is taken from board firmware or static board file
definition, so if gpiod_count() returns 0 it should be clear indication
that the driver should not be used with the device.

Thanks.
