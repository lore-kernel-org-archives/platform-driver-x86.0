Thanks for being persistent, some good points in there. I'd like to just squash
these into this patch (9/16), but I'll include them here for an ack from you and
Andy L. that this is what you meant, and consistent with his
intent/understanding:

Per:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/platform-driver-x86/msg08201.html

Eliminate the kfree of a wblock with a null bus now that we ignore
duplicate GUIDs in parse_wdg.

Move the out_free_pointer: label and kfree to the end of the function,
clearly marking it as a return path.

Rework the device_add loop at the end of parse_wdg to avoid leaking the
wblock, and symmetrically call wmi_method_enable() if (debug_event).
