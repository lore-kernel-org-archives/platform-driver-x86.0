More to the point, the reason why virt_to_phys() needs to be used in patch [2/2]
seems to be a nasty hack in the ASUS AML that pretty much expects us to provide
the physical address as an argument.

And I don't really understand the Matthew's comment regarding limiting
operation regions to system memory.  This is about a specific operation
region (which BTW only seems to be used as a means to access system memory
at the location pointed to by the arg) in that particular method.

Matthew?
