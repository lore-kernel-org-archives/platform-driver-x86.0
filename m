The new B series BIOS has version string 43CN46WW. The driver
requires that 2nd and 3rd characters be 'E' and 'T' respectively,
where as the newer BIOS has 'C' and 'N' respectively. Failing to
load the module causes some of the hotkeys to not work.

This was tested by me on Lenovo B470e and on B570e by James Ferguson
