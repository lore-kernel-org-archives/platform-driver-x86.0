Well, persistent means:
"Whether the soft blocked state is initialised from non-volatile
storage at startup."
So if we call rfkill_init_sw_state(), that makes some sense

We are missing some context here. What is the hotkey doing in userspace ?
Who owns this phy0 rfkill ? The asus platform driver, or the wireless driver ?
If it's the asus platform driver, why is it different from bluetooth ?
Something special done by the BIOS ? or the driver ?
