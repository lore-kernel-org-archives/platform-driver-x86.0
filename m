Really libsmbios matters here? Hans (added to thread) wrote that
libsmbios is a relic, something of ages long gone by and a normal user
should never use it.

If this is truth and libsmbios should not be used, then we probably do
not need to care about it in changes for WMI.

Hans, Mario, any comment/clarification about it?

Maybe we can use this Dell WMI-ACPI wrapper for kernel drivers instead
of current SMI/SMM direct access?
