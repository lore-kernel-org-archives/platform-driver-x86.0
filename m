Hi,

sorry for the inconvenience this change has caused.

Would I have known the impact, then yes. This change was added due to
some reported instances where it seems that soc_button_array would
occasionally load on MSHW0040 before the GPIO controller was ready,
causing power and volume buttons to not work.

Correct. After a comment mentioned that gpiod_get() returning
-EPROBE_DEFER would be the proper way to detect this, I decided on this
change.

Might I suggest the following addition:
