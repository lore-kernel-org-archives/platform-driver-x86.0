This needs a clearer description here in this comment, rather than redirecting
the reader to a bug report (which may or may not exist when needed).

Hrm, this checking for the existence of a specific method seems suspect to me.
We would know if we are on a TOS1900 as we matches the acpi id already. Is the
SPFC significant here, or is it just a "we only see SPFC on TOS1900 so it's a
convenient test"? If the latter, it seems rather fragile and prone to other
breakage to me.

Rafael, any recommendations here?
