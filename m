I'm having some trouble grokking the whole picture I think.

So, let's try and clear it up. We have a function to set brightness. On model
citizen laptops, after the ACPI call, out[2] is 0 (TOS_SUCCESS) and we return 0.

The extra check was added by f6aac65 to avoid registering certain badly behaved
machines (Qosmios) which always return HCI_SUCCESS, even the read/write commands
are missing. This was determined by checking for observed values in out[2]
greater than 0 and out[3] equal to 0xE000 (which presumably map to actual or max
brightness. I take it in a well behaved ACPI implementation, out[2] must be 0
and out[3] is .... what? I'll call this out[2] || out[3] state the "signature"
of a bad implementation.

Now, with bug 86521, we learn that these signatures are not necessarily bad,
some working laptops also populate these fields in this way.

Finally, while it is only TOS1900 devices that are known to be bad, all TOS1900
devices are not necessarily bad. So you don't want to block all TOS1900 devices
at probe time.

Do I have this right?

If so, this is looking more and more fragile to me. I'm inclined to push for a
blacklist of the known bad models and strip out both this and the precious extra
check, since they are based on circumstantial evidence of failure.

Rafael, what's your take on this? Does the above influence your position one way
or the other?
