Can you name it e.g. something that should be neutral such as:

QUIRK_ROG_NKEY_ID1_ID2_INIT

I'm not sure if ROG NKEY should still be included into the name based on 
what Denis mentioned about recent models but at least it gets rid of the 
"legacy" connotation. If wider scope is necessary you could use just
QUIRK_ID1_ID2_INIT.
