On Dell Latitude 7275 the 5-button array is not exposed in the
ACPI tables, but still notifies are sent to the Intel HID device
object (device ID INT33D5) in response to power button actions.
They were ignored as the intel-hid driver was not prepared to
take care of them until recently.

Power button wakeup from suspend-to-idle was added in:
635173a17b03 ("intel-hid: Wake up Dell Latitude 7275 from
suspend-to-idle"). However power button suspend doesn't work
yet on this platform so it would be good to add it also.

On the affected platform (for which priv->array is NULL), add
a new upfront check against the power button press notification
(0xCE) to notify_handler(), outside the wakeup mode this time,
which allows to report the power button press event and
trigger the suspend. Also catch and ignore the corresponding
power button release notification (0xCF) to stop it from being
reported as an "unknown event" in the logs.
