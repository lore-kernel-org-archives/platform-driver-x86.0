There are other examples in the kernel of the same data accessible in multi=

different methods that can cause inconsistencies too.

To get this started can you re-review Andy's platform/wmi tree and merge in=
 some
of his bus work?  Regardless of the outcome of the access to userspace and =
dynamic
binding this is a good direction for WMI support in platform/drivers/x86 to=
 get started.

I've been studying more about how this access to WMI BIOS functions on Wind=
ows
works this week and uncovered what I see as another set of related question=
s around
commitment to manageability access from the OS with this potential userspac=
e layer.

On Windows what happens is the MOF data (same stuff exposed by Andy's wmi-m=
of)
is imported into the WMI namespace.  This allows any tools to know exactly =
how
to interact with the various GUID's associated to the ASL methods.  The for=
mat of the
data and the arguments supported are encoded directly in that MOF data.

This means that standard WBEM tools are able to interact directly with thes=
e methods
based upon exposed objects.  BIOS manufacturer can expose say all BIOS sett=
ings that=20
are integer to a GUID for interacting with integer settings and those would=
 get loaded=20
into the WMI namespace.  When someone uses a WBEM tool to modify that objec=
t
the data is properly formatted into the correct arguments for an integer an=
d then run=20
through the ASL.  Another GUID might be made for strings and another for sp=
ecially
crafted lists (like a boot order).  The important part is that all settings=
 are discoverable
and no extra tools are needed to administer a box.  It can all be done from=
 things like=20
PowerShell or wmic.

In an ideal world I think this is the right solution for Linux too, as part=
 of this pipe we've
discussed let some userspace Linux WBEM tools like OpenLMI have access to a=
 BIOS
provider that can interact with various settings.

Unfortunately the MOF data that comes out of wmi-mof is so called "Binary M=
OF" which
has been pre-compiled to an intermediate format with mofcomp.exe on Windows=
.
The format of binary MOF is not documented and the only known way to get te=
xt=20
mof back out is by using mofcomp.exe with some esoteric arguments.

mofcomp.exe -MOF:recovered.mof -MFL:ms_409.mof -Amendment:MS_409 binary_mof=
_file

So with that said, what role should the Linux kernel actually play here?

My thought is it still makes sense to make this pipe available to potential=
ly enable WBEM
tools at some point.  At least until a way to deconstruct binary MOF is mad=
e available,
it's conceivable to build a provider from reverse engineered discovery of h=
ow the ASL works,
it just won't be as "pretty" as the type of data you get out of MOF with na=
me and value mappings.
