When Acer notebook ship with Windows, they will preload a userland
application, the name is Launch Manager, it provide a GUI for end user
to change WLAN/BT/3G on/off state.

So, Acer wmi method have this function to provide the userland
application can call it to disable the default EC behavior in wifi
hotkey. After disable the hotkey's default behavior, it will only send
out wmi event when user press wifi key and doesn't touch any WLAN/BT/3G
state.

If Linux distro provide userland application the features like Acer
Launch Manager on Windows, then it can set the launch_manager to 1 to
change the wifi hotkey behavior.
Because the Launch Manager is userland application, so wmi driver only
can provide the function for it to call and don't have any way can
detect it from kernel module.

I thought it similar to disable rfkill_input by /dev/rfkill, the
different is disable rfkill_input need use ioctl, but I put a module
option in acer-wmi driver.


Thank's a lot!
