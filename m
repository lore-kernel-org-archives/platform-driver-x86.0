Nope, as I've written earlier:

Looking at 0002-GPIO-Adding-AXP288-PMIC-GPIO-driver.patch from ProductionKernelQuilts,
it doesn't seem hard to do the same for the TI PMIC, but it needs information
from the PMIC datasheet for irq and gpio control registers.
Hopefully you have a patch or at least could provide the information.


Thanks,
