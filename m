[Subsequent messages from Chris clarified that both eeepc-laptop and
eeepc-wmi suffer as described below]

I suggest you contact the ACPI video maintainer, Zhang Rui
<rui.zhang-ral2JQCrhuEAvxtiuMwx3w@public.gmane.org>, and attach the output of "dmidecode".  The best
way would probably be to report the problem on bugzilla.kernel.org (on
the ACPI video driver).

I think it will indeed be possible to blacklist your machine, because
someone has already anticipated this problem :-).


drivers/acpi/video_detect.c:

long acpi_video_get_capabilities(acpi_handle graphics_handle)
...
		/* Add blacklists here. Be careful to use the right *DMI* bits
		 * to still be able to override logic via boot params, e.g.:
		 *
		 *   if (dmi_name_in_vendors("XY")) {
...
		 *	acpi_video_support |=
		 *		ACPI_VIDEO_BACKLIGHT_DMI_VENDOR;
		 *}
		 */
