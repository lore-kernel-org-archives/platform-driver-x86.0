After taking a look at brightness_show() and its git history
it is clear that the comment became invalid after the commit
ca3259b36035 ("leds: Add support to leds with readable status").

I will submit a patch adding mutex protection there soon.

Yes, general lack of synchronization in the LED core also drew
my attention at first, but after analysis I came to conclusion
that it was harmless and didn't result in leaving the subsystem
in an inconsistent state. So far it seems not to have beaten anyone.

Yes, if we're going to report all brightness change events
consistently then it is a good candidate.
