I'd assert that wasn't the right call. Happy to discuss with them if they are
interested.

I suppose it depends what you mean by support. If you mean have one kernel that
runs on everything from embedded dev boards to HPC, I think you'll find that to
be an untenable goal. In my time maintaining the Yocto Project BSPs for Intel,
it is still the case that embedded systems prefer to run more tailored kernels.
We tried to reduce that change as much as possible on IA, by at least building
from the same source branch, but ultimately, people want to change configuration
options on embedded systems.

This works great for Desktops and Datacenters, but it doesn't hold up very long
in discussions with the more embedded and special purpose device space.

:-) Agreed on all points

The liklihood of use is the most compelling argument. e1000 is very likely to be
used relative to silead-touchscreen, for example. If it's highly specialized, it
should typically be default n (or not default y|m as discussed above). Of course
people like you ultimately are on the hook to make that call.

I can see that view, especiacally coming from your position.
