It is also good to consider the example given in cleanup.h though, in
which there is the

            struct object *obj __free(remove_free) =3D NULL;

pattern leading to a real bug due to a cleanup ordering issue.

I would prefer to avoid encouraging people to create code patterns
that are potentially problematic.  The "free" or "constructor"
terminology mentioned above boils down to avoiding those code patterns
which also matters in practice.

No, they haven't, AFAICS.  At least I'm not aware of any attempts to do so.
