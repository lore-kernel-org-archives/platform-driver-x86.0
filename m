Sorry, but I do not understand how you mean it... Why to provides new=20
read/write i2c functions which are already implemented by i2c-i801 bus=20
and lis3lv02d i2c driver?

> Alternatively, can lis3lv02d be tasked to create /dev/freefall?

If i2c_board_info contains IRQ then lis3lv02d create /dev/freefall=20
device.

But... what is problem with current implementation? Accelerometer HW=20
provides two functions:

1) 3 axes reports
2) Disk freefall detection

And 1) is handled by i2c driver lis3lv02d and 2) is by dell-smo8800.=20
Both functions are independent here.

I think you just trying to complicate this situation even more to be=20
more complicated as currently is.
