I can imagine a real production userspace app that parses BMOF data.
Imagine you write a thingy that calls some laptop method foo(1) where
foo is defined in the MOF.  You could hardcode the mapping to the
GUID, but you could also parse the BMOF.

More like /debug/wmi/<bus name>/_wdg, but yes.  I wish there was a
standard way to make a debugfs directory corresponding to a sysfs
path.  Maybe this exists -- I'll look.

FWIW, almost all the _WDG data is already there in sysfs in Linus'
tree.  See, for example, cat
/sys/devices/platform/PNP0C14:01/wmi_bus/wmi_bus-PNP0C14:01/05901221-D566-11D1-B2F0-00A0C9062910/object_id
