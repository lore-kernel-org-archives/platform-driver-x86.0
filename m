Windows/KEY_LEFTMETA can be used as a modifier key, e.g. in combination wit=
h=20
the Volume Up/Down keys. On Windows, the default for Win + VolumeUp creates=
 a=20
screenshot.

You can also use this in combination with an onscreen keyboard. Pressing th=
e=20
hardware button with the hand holding the tablet and typing with the other=
=20
hand on the OSK is probably easier than hitting both keys on the OSK.

Additionally, the Volume Up/Down currently do not autorepeat, as the key is
autoreleased on the press event. The XPS 12 does issue distinct press/relea=
se=20
events, so this could be done properly. The same apparently holds for some=
=20
other convertibles, see the links in Patch 1/5.

Kind regards,

Stefan
