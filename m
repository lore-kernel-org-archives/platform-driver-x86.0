I have not read the datasheet (I do not even know if it is available to=
=20
the public; I have not looked), but I would not expect to see a power=20
limit of 0 even if the CPU is on fire. Of course, you have to be more=20
cautious when validating the current temperature (and even then, if it=20
says the CPU is encased in a block of ice, something odd is going on).

Of course. (But you most probably will want to s/server/laptop/ here.)

This is not an alarm module; AFAIK it is a module for the feature in=20
recent Intel CPU/GPU chips which allow you to overclock it a bit as lon=
g=20
as the thermal and power limit has not been exceeded:

config INTEL_IPS
	tristate "Intel Intelligent Power Sharing"
	depends on ACPI
	---help---
	  Intel Calpella platforms support dynamic power sharing between the
	  CPU and GPU, maximizing performance in a given TDP.  This driver,
	  along with the CPU frequency and i915 drivers, provides that
	  functionality.  If in doubt, say Y here; it will only load on
	  supported platforms.

If the module is not loaded, it simply will not be able to go above its=
=20
nominal clock, so refusing to load it is not that much of a problem.
