One should not affect the other.

One did not affect another, and it should not.

Why? These are separate concepts. Do we disable wake on lan when
bringing network interface down? Do we update power/wakeup when device
is inhibited? Do we restore it afterwards? Do we un-inhibit if we
reenable wakeup after device is inhibited? Do we return error? How?

Inhibit works on logical level, i.e. if I have several input interfaces
on the same hardware device, I cam inhibit one leaving others intact.
This does not mean that the device should stop generating wakeup events.
We can't even guarantee this for composite devices.

However it will not work. For many input devices connected to i2c we
declare interrupt as wakeup interrupt, and the driver does not need to
issue enable_irq_wake() and disable_irq_wake(). The wakeup handling is
happening in driver core, which is not aware of input-specific inhibit
(nor should it be).

I need to ping Mark about the patch adding the similar handling to SPI.

You do not need to push the knowledge into logind, you just need to
communicate to logind what devices can be wakeup sources and which ones
should not. Chrome OS uses udev tags/properties for that.

This is a policy and should be kept out of the kernel. Yes, we had it
implemented with rfkill input handler, but it caused quite a few issues.
As far as I know it is not being used anymore and we should not try with
SW_LID->inhibit either.

I know it is faster to patch the kernel than to roll out proper
userspace because everyone updates kernel regularly, but it does not
mean it is the right solution.

Thanks.
