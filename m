It should be removed too, the same applies to power_supply as to everything
else; uevents are a broken interface for any kind of device data which
is not meant as a trigger to re-configure the device itself.

But power_supply events are at least not as unfixable as backlight,
the number of events can be kept relatively low during normal
operation. So it can happen after the backlight thing is sorted out.

Note: The same rule as for generating uevents applies also to device
properties exported in the environment too; measurement data has no
place there. Reading the "uevent" file of a battery in sysfs (we need to
do that at bootup) sometimes synchronously blocks 1 second to return,
just because it tries to add measurement data reading it live from the
hardware to add it to the event itself.
