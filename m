I was thinking the same when implementing this, so this is fine with
me. I think it is best to just unconditionally call
power_supply_set_input_current_limit_from_supplier from the
external_power_changed callback, that will only get called if we've
a parent supply and that function will check that the parent has
a current-max property itself.

Please let me know if just unconditionally calling
power_supply_set_input_current_limit_from_supplier from the
external_power_changed callback is ok with you then I will do that
for v3 of the patch-set (from which I will drop the patches you've
already queued).

Regards,

Hans
