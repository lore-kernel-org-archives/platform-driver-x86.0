Not sure about that, but I guess this is needed:

FWIW, now I came across yet another source for this driver:
https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/x86/+/android-x86-grant-3.10-marshmallow-mr1-wear-release/drivers/external_drivers/drivers/mfd/intel_pmic/
(but seems to be older)

You seem to suggest I should try and tackle it myself,
which I would do, but for one I don't want to step on
Mika's toes, secondly ISTR you indicated you have newer,
better source than what is available publicly?
If you want me to take it, please let me know which tree
to work against and any other suggestions you have.

Some more questions:
- Powerbutton driver seems simple enough, the only specialty
  of the TI dcove PB driver is the workarond for lost button
  press event after resume.  However, I still don't see how
  the PB would cause thermal event irqs on E200HA and how the
  PMIC driver would change it?
- Wakeup from freeze state (E200HA doesn't support suspend / ACPI S3)
  is only step 1, to make it usable we need S0ix support.
  Any hints about that?

I think the mfd driver would be similar to intel_soc_pmic_crc.c,
the dollar_cove_ti_powerbtn.c I would keep instead of merging
it into intel_mid_powerbtn.c.  I guess what we need is in
drivers/acpi/pmic/ something similar to intel_pmic_crc.c,
the ProductionKernelQuilts has 0001-ACPI-Adding-support-for-TI-pmic-opregion.patch.


Thanks,
Johannes
