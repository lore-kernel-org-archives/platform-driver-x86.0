Maybe we should first ask, why linux userspace applications need direct
access to WMI? If we look at current WMI linux drivers, basically every
one translate WMI interface to some standard linux class driver (with
some extensions). This is something which should stay in kernel. E.g.
rfkill, backlight, led, input keyboard, ...
