This patch contains at least three logical changes and needs splitting:

* unify documentation
* adding helpers
* MAINTAINERS addition

Documentation and MAINTAINERS changes should go last in the patchset.

Accordingly, the huuge commit message below should be spread around
those three patches.

This looks like a 4th patch ontop of the unifying documentation one.

A pointer to the wikipedia page would suffice instead of us repeating
ELF history here.

Btw, that last sentence is kinda funny and not really needed. Or do you
wanna say that everything-code is in a section?

Are you sure we need 4 levels of hierarchy?

If so, we should document what all those section, core, name and level
mean and how the whole sections hierarchy is supposed to look like.

That's just too many words for nothing. You can just as well say:

implement mark_rodata_ro()."

"first init userspace process" either say "prior to calling init" or
"prior to calling the first userspace process" but both is jambalayed
into something confusing.

That's one ugly footnote. Also, the git commit id suffices, you don't

Also, this is not what __define_initcall() does. It is not defining init levels.

That sounds yucky.

An init level is a bunch of functions which are called after init_level
- 1 and before init_level + 1.

Eeww, too long and it is a getter but doesn't have "GET" in its name.

How about GET_SECTION_ALIGN() ?

And what's with the "LINUX_" prefix - that's like useless use of screen
