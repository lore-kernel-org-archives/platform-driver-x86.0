If I understand it correctly, there is problem that i2c lis3lv02d driver
needs to get IRQ number for freefall and in current structure you pass
host notify IRQ number.

It means that one property in lis3lv02d driver is used for two things:
free fall IRQ and host notify IRQ. So the only way how to fix it is to
use two different IRQ properties. Probably free fall IRQ is lis3lv02d
specific and should be in platform data structure, not in generic
i2c_board_info shared across all i2c drivers?
