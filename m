The patches don't apply, but looks like the native backlight control
patch is now in Linus' 3.0 tree, and I could cherry-pick Matthew's last
iteration of the i915 patch (from July 7th) from linux-next onto 3.0-rc=
7.

Going to update my bug report to reflect this. Now the only problem is =
I
have both acpi_video0 and intel_backlight, and GNOME Power Manager uses
the former rather than the latter. Manually setting the brightness
through the intel_backlight interface works.

Thanks, everyone.
