So overall, something like this can be defined

static inline void free_acpi_object(union acpi_object *obj)
{
        ACPI_FREE(obj);
}

DEFINE_FREE(acpi_object_free, union acpi_object *, free_acpi_object(_T))

and used along with acpi_evaluate_dsm*().

Moreover, a wrapper around acpi_evaluate_object() returning a pointer
to union acpi_object on success and NULL on failure can be defined and
used along with the above.

IMV that would be way cleaner than wrapping a raw cleanup macro around
ACPI_FREE().

I generally think that there needs to be a wrapper layer around the
ACPICA API, so drivers don't need to call functions returning
acpi_status directly, for instance.

Someday we'll get there.
