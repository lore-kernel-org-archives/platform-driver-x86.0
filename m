All the complications discussed above are exactly why I still
believe that there should be only open and close.

If error propagation on inhibit is considered as something
really important to have then we can make the input driver close
callback return an error (*), note I'm talking about the
driver close callback here, not the system call.

If the close callback is called for actually closing the fd
referring to the input node, then the new error return code
can be ignored, as we already do for errors on close atm
since the driver close callback returns void.

I still have not seen a very convincing argument for having
separate inhibit and close callbacks and as the messy discussion
above shows, having 2 such very similar yet subtly different
calls seems like a bad idea...

Regards,

Hans


*) This will require a flag day where "return 0" is added
to all current close handlers
