You seem to know the history better than I do, but if there are
significant power savings or some faint noise removed (e g by turning an
amplifier off or so) by using the hardware mute, then it could still be
worth pursuing.

Yes, essentially. HDA has support for GPIOs, and HP on IDT codecs use
that to control LEDs. HP on Realtek codecs (not as common) use VREF
outputs on unused mic pins.

I see your point, but the question is what is more of a privacy guard
here. Do you expect USB mics and Bluetooth mics/headsets to be muted too?

If so, are you expecting some kind of kernel-wide block of recording,
including bluetooth, USB, and other sound cards? It does not sound like
a practical approach to me.

And if not, where do you draw the line and why?

To decide what the LEDs bind to is a design issue. I was thinking that
by giving control to userspace would give different
implementations/distros/etc the most freedom to do what design they wanted.

However, since, the hotkeys and the mutes are often very closely related
physically (e g the mute LED is physically located on the mute button),
I would expect them to follow each other. And the mute hotkey mutes the
current default PulseAudio output, so I'd expect the mic mute hotkey to
mute the current default PulseAudio input, and the LEDs to update
according to those mute states.

The privacy issue is interesting, but I don't see a practical way of
implementing things that would protect us against compromised userspaces.
