No, the commenter in bugzilla reports that it happened after manually
outputting the command to debugfs. Of course, the same command is used
by this patch only if the sysfs attribute is enabled.

samsung_init returns -ENODEV if the computer boots in UEFI. Some
functionality (e.g. the battery saving mode, SABI access for this lid
handling issue, some LED functionality for other laptops) have no
alternative ways to be accessed without this module. But this issue is
only tangentially related to my patch.

I have sent the revised patch as a reply to the first patch.

Thank you.
