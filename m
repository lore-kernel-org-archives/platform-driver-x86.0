This all makes sense - good context for the commit message. If no other changes
end up being needed, I'm happy to paste it in at merge. If changes are required,
please add it in v3.

It sounds like this is spotty across intel-vbtn implementations? Some devices
emit release, others do not? How would you teach the driver about the
differences? Assume autorelease and change the sparse keymap entry for DMI
matched platforms with release? Doable... sounds unpleasant to maintain and
update. Do we support this fully in userspace already?
