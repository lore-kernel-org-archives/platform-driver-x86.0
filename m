I'm not seeing a lot of consensus here and afaict the v2 patch:

--- a/drivers/video/backlight/backlight.c~drivers-video-backlight-backlightc-remove-backlight-sysfs-uevent
+++ a/drivers/video/backlight/backlight.c
@@ -175,8 +175,6 @@ static ssize_t brightness_store(struct d
 	}
 	mutex_unlock(&bd->ops_lock);
 
-	backlight_generate_event(bd, BACKLIGHT_UPDATE_SYSFS);
-
 	return rc;
 }
 static DEVICE_ATTR_RW(brightness);

will still break userspace which relies on BACKLIGHT_UPDATE_SYSFS
uevents.  I see no way we can guarantee that there is no such userspace
so the patch is worrying.

Should we instead be looking for a way of avoiding this risk?  Say, add
a new knob which people can set if they don't want to generate this
event?  Ugly, but that's the price we pay for mucking it up originally.
