It is really hard to split this patch into more parts which every=20
one will compile and ideally also work. In my opinion every=20
single git commit should be possible to compile and should also=20
work (it helps also other developers to use git bisect).

And because we need to pass all (previous unchanged) values in=20
smbios call we need to parse all of them.

I understand that it could be hard to review long patch, but=20
there are more parts which interacts and do not work without=20
other. Also some of settings (e.g keyboard backlight level) could=20
be changed via different ways (and on some machines only one is=20
working) and also that smbios keyboard interface has complicated=20
logic...

I will fix style problems in next v3 patch.
=20
What to do with Dan Carpenter patch which fixing kbd_timeout=20
handling? Should I integrate it into v3? It does not apply on top=20
of next v3 patch, because there will be new comment about quirk=20
plus style fixes...
