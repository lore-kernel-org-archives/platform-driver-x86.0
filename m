I'm fine with it wherever...

TPACPI_SYSFS_VERSION needs to be increased when you add some feature or
change some behaviour that userspace needs to know to be present/ausent AND
which cannot be detected by other means (such as the presence of a sysfs
node).  A good example is poll() support for sysfs nodes.

If you need to bump TPACPI_SYSFS_VERSION, you absolutely must add the proper
documentation for the feature to Documentation/laptops/thinkpad-acpi.txt.

TPACPI_VERSION is mostly cosmetic, and adding the mute LED driver looks like
as good a reason to bump it as any other.  You need to at least describe the
new functionality and bump the driver version and date in
Documentation/laptops/thinkpad-acpi.txt.

Other than that, it looks good from the thinkpad-acpi side.  I'll ack it if
you update Documentation/laptops/thinkpad-acpi.txt.
