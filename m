OK, confirm acer-aspire_5720 keymap works fine on my ZG8. I added the
following rule to /lib/udev/rules.d/95-keymap.rules:

ENV{DMI_VENDOR}=3D=3D"Acer*", ATTR{[dmi/id]product_serial}=3D=3D"ZG8*",=
 RUN+=3D"keymap $name acer-aspire_5720"

I will send patch to udev group. But I am not sure acer-aspire_5720 key=
map also works to you:

0x84 bluetooth  # sent when bluetooth module missing, and key pressed
0x92 media      # acer arcade
0xD4 bluetooth  # bluetooth on
0xD9 bluetooth  # bluetooth off

Do you need me help to send out patch to udev group for your machine?=20


Thank's=20
