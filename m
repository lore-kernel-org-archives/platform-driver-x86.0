Except for the last patch set ( which has fix for typec driver 
compilation issue) that I sent yesterday,
all other patch set versions are bisectable.

The problem was when I first created this patch set, typec wcove driver 
was not merged upstream.
After creating the initial set, I was just improving the patch set and 
forgot to re-check for
child devices that depend of PMIC MFD driver.  Thats why we came across 
this compilation issue.

In future, I will try to avoid these kind of issues. I think adding 
"allyesconfig" and "allmodconfig"
compilation tests to my patch submit criteria should prevent these kind 
of issues.
