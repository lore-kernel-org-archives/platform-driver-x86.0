Hrm, while sysfs details can change across kernel versions, usually due to
driver core changes, we try to keep them as consistent as possible so as not to
break userspace.

That said, if we are going to try and come up with a better model for
representing an accelerometer, wouldn't treating it as an IIO device be the more
logical approach?
