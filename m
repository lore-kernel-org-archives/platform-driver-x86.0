Alright, that is basically what I was expecting it to be. As it happens,
this also means that we'll have to decide what to do about returning
-EIO/-ENODEV/rv in show_sys_acpi and store_sys_acpi. The latter was
changed by Paul Bolle's "eeepc-laptop: simplify parse_arg()". The return
value of these functions is propagated to the sysfs interface.

Agreed.

While I was removing the patches changing the sysfs error behavior, I
also noticed that eeepc-laptop.c doesn't really seem to handle errors
uniformly. In some cases the callers of get_acpi and set_acpi don't even
seem to consider that these functions may return an error code (e.g.
eeepc_hotk_thaw()). I'd fix those in a new series though.
