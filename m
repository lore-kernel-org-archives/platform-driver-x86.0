I only own a pretty old MacBook Air with just NVIDIA IGP and had to
rely on BUG reports and testing from affected users.

Not doing anything on apple-gmux when only a single GPU is visible
should be easy, but denying any vgaarb operation when Intel IGP is
hidden and just discrete GPU present is much harder (if one does not
want to risk opening the next can of worms).

DMI based special-casing would work but will it uncover the next issue
with the same device configured differently?
