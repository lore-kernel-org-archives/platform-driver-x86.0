I'm not entirely sure what you mean. I'm not aware that LED multicolor clas=
s
devices would be instantiated from 3 ordinary LED devices - although it's p=
ossible
I have missed it.

Ahh, you're right. My bad. The "devicename" part is indeed optional.

 In this case it is preferable to just concatenate the predefined LED_FUNCT=
ION_* name with required =E2=80=9C-N=E2=80=9D suffix in the driver. fwnode =
based drivers can use function-enumerator property for that and then the co=
ncatenation will be handled automatically by the LED core upon LED class de=
vice registration.
