OK, I went and reviewed the MOF docs, our previous discussions, and your bmf2moc
code (awesome by the way). So, agreed - we need easy access to _WDG and BMOF for
development purposes.

Having the kernel expose a guid/class/method interface should provide the
abstraction Rafael called for.

The question then, is should these two things be in sysfs, where they become
more or less permanent, or are they better off in debugfs, where they can be
used by developers as needed, but are not present on production systems, and
we are not bound to the representation we use from now until forever.

Seems to me:

/debug/wmi/<GUID>/bmof
/debug/wmi/<GUID>/_wdg

would be the most appropriate location for these.
