It definitely looks like an ACPI issue.
That function is defined in `drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_acpi.c'.
The whole file was added more than a year ago by commit 723bfd707a97
(see the relevant thread on intel-gfx@ [1]) to "add _DSM support".
One of the first comment is about "Calpella", which is exactly the
platform of my laptop (as shown by lshw)

However, I honestly don't know what is wrong with that code...
Is there anything I can provide to sort things out?

I just bumped on bug report #29821 on freedesktop.org [2] which dates
the "flicker" bug around 2.6.35. I guess the ubuntu kernel doesn't
have the fix (and actually, the fix might be responsible for the lack
of output on the second display with later kernels.)

I'll try with an older kernel to see what it does.

Actually, the first thing I did was wiping Windows out :)
=46rom what I've seen, both screens seem to work out-of-the-box on
Windows.

There are only two physical keys:
 - power-on button
 - "keyboard"-labeled button, which seems to do nothing
   hardware-related; it triggers an event caught up by acer_wmi.
   I think all it does is telling the OS: "hey, pull up the software
   virtual keyboard on the second display".

I meant an internal switch that would be controlled by GPIO or
such. It doesn't seem very likely though...

See [3] for dmidecode, I've also provided the dsdt [4] again.
Here is also everything related to ACPI in dmesg [5].

Let me know if there's anything else I can provide,
