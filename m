Including the actual architectural definition of the bit might add some
clarity.  The SDM explicitly says (Vol 3a section 4.7):

	The fault resulted from violation of SGX-specific access-control
	requirements.

Which totally squares with returning true from access_error().

There's also a tidbit that says:

	This flag is 1 if the exception is unrelated to paging and
	resulted from violation of SGX-specific access-control
	requirements. ... such a violation can occur only if there
	is no ordinary page fault...

This is pretty important.  It means that *none* of the other
paging-related stuff that we're doing applies.

We also need to clarify how this can happen.  Is it through something
than an app does, or is it solely when the hardware does something under
the covers, like suspend/resume.
