I'm curious which vendor documentation you're working with here.

From the spec,
0 = normal
1 = overboost
2 = silent

Also you can use DSTS on the 0x00110018 device to check the exact
capabilities supported, which you should use to refine which modes can
be cycled through.
Bit 0 = overboost supported
Bit 1 = silent supported

Thanks
Daniel
