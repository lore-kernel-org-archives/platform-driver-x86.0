I believe the latter is the case, the old A series also had this
problem. Of course applying the patch will break other models (SZ is one
I'm sure about) so there is no actual winner here unless we figure out
how to properly decode keys on sonypi models (this problem is
specifically related to two phase hotkey decoding, see the irq handler).
=2E..I don't have any such old laptop anymore with me.
