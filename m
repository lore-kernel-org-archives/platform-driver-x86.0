There might exist users that adjust LED brightness while having
active trigger. The best example is default-on trigger - it sets
brightness only on init, but remains active all the time. Whereas
this could be fixed, there is another case: think of changing blinking
brightness - it would be impossible.

Isn't it under firmware control all the time?

Sheer user is not interested in design, but in usability.
