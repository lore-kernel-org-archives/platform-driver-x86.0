I think we should create MFD driver for PMC and remove the redundant 
resource and platform device creation codes.
Yes, there is common code in IPC implementation between scu_ipc and 
pmc_ipc code. This needs be modularized.

I can work on it and send a RFC patch for this cleanup. But it could 
take more time for merging this cleanup patch.
So I think, in the mean time, we should merge this watchdog fix first to 
remove iTCO watchdog device probe issue.
