Apparently networkign people is not quite happy with rfkill-input
behavior and would like to move policy from the kernel into userspace.
To tell the truth rfkill-input was never supposed to be the main
mechanism but rather something that is usable at bootup and then the
control would be handed off to userspace (if more complex policy is
needed).

OEMs have nothing to do with this, user is the entity that should be in
control.

I believe that we simply need to tell EC to keep its hands off RF
switch. As long as key is properly reported through input layer rfkill
should be able to control the RF equipment, either via rfkill-input
in-kernel shortcut or userspace daemon (when it is ready).

Thanks.
