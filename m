I think this is step backward. Current wmi drivers in kernel which=20
implements class devices should stay in kernel -- independently of fact=20
if they are provided by WMI API, ACPI API or direct HW access.

Maybe... I agree that having WMI API for userspace application could be=20
useful, but it should not be at cost of loosing current kernel drivers=20
or kernel functionality provided by current kernel wmi drivers.

The question is, who is interested in full WMI access from userspace?=20
And who already requested it in past? I'm just asking if we are not=20
going to work on something in which nobody is interested...

Yes, we know from Mario that Dell is interested in WMI access from=20
userspace. But is there other vendor? At least I do not know, so this is=20
reason why I suggested to rather create API specially for Dell which=20
will fully fit for both userspace Dell applications and also kernel dell=20
wmi drivers to minimize conflicts.

I'm sure that specific API/ABI designed for concrete usage (here in=20
Dell) would be easier and also better in resolving conflicts and=20
fighting between kernel & userspace as some fully generic API/ABI which=20
needs to be designed for everything and everybody.

What worry me is that there will be kernel wmi drivers which due to=20
conflicts in locking/usage would not be able to allow userspace to=20
access WMI. Or if their implemented filter would not fullfit for vendor=20
userspace application (for some reasons), and vendor userspace=20
application starts blocking kernel wmi modules. This would mean that=20
user would be in position where must decide if he wants: stable kernel=20
driver for controlling rfkill/led and receive hotkey presses OR=20
userspace application which can control charging, setting special BIOS=20
settings/etc/... And if laptop vendors do not want to coordinate work=20
with kernel upstream, this situation can really happen.

Yes, that is truth for obvious reason.

I did not know about any discussion too.

Ok, I will write there other notes.
