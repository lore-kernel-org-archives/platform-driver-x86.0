I removed the platform device because it seems a bit redundant to have
both, and I don't see what benefit it really provides. I see your point
that conceptually it makes sense to have it has a platform device,
although the distinction there is pretty fine.

Anyway, I guess the cost of keeping the platform device in place is
pretty small, so I can add it back in if that's desirable.

I was avoiding chainging any userspace interfaces in this first round of
patches, but deprecating the proc interface is definitely something I'd
like to do. I don't know if there's any point to moving it to sysfs
though. Most of it already has sysfs interfaces via device classes, and
I don't know that there's any value in the rest of it.

Thanks,
Seth
