I ordered E200HA from the above link. It should arrive soon so I have
not yet started working on it. My colleaque (Erik Veijola, CC'd) is
actually doing the real work - I'll help him when there is need.

About the time frame, once the machine arrives we'll start working and
try to get the patches ready as soon as possible (but remember we have
other things to do as well).

Let's use the bugzilla entry to track progress.
