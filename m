I guess there will be plenty of time to argue about all of that.

In the meantime, I wanted to confirm that your jarkko-sgx/master
branch contains the proposed driver that is headed upstream.  Before
adding the SFLC patches we thought it best to run the driver through
some testing in order to verify that any problems we generated where
attributable to our work and not the base driver.

At the current time jarkko-sgx/master appears to be having difficulty
initializing the unit test enclave for our trusted runtime API
librarary.  Enclave creation and loading appear to work fine, things
go south after the EINIT ioctl is called on the loaded image.

We specifically isolated the regressions to occur secondary to the
EINIT ioctl being called.  We modified our sgx-load test utility to
pause with the image loaded, but not initialized.  We generated a fair
amount of system activity while the process was holding the enclave
image open and there were no issues.  The process was then allowed to
unmap the virtual memory image without calling EINIT and the system
was fine after that as well.

Symptoms vary, but in all cases appear to be linked to corruption of
the virtual memory infrastructure.  In all cases, the kernel ends up
at a point where any attempt to start a new process hangs and becomes
uninterruptible.  The full kernel failure does not appear to be
synchronous with when EINIT is called, which would support the notion
that something is going wrong with the VM management that is being
workqueue deferred.

This is with your MPX patch applied that corrects issues with the
wrong memory management context being acted upon by that system.  In
any event, the kernel configuration being used for testing does not
have MPX support even enabled.  Given that the changelog for the patch
is indicating the new driver is attempting something unique with
workqueue deferred VM management, it would seem possible that the
driver is tickling bad and possibly untested behavior elsewhere in the
kernel as well.

The enclave in question is not terribly sophisticated by the standards
of our other enclaves, but it is a non-trivial test of SGX
functionality.  It weighs in at about 156K and is generated and signed
in debug mode with version 1.4 compliant metadata.  Obviously it
initializes and runs fine with the out-of-tree driver.

We managed to capture two separate sets of error logs/backtraces that
are included below.  As I'm sure you know, without module support,
working on all of this is a bit painful as it requires the classic
edit-compile-link-boot-whimper procedure.... :-)

Given that the self-test committed to the kernel sources is a trivial
one page enclave and the proposed driver ABI is incompatible with the
released Intel Linux PSW/SDK, this may be the most challenging test
the driver has been put through.  Unless your PSW/SDK team is testing
the new driver behind the scenes.

Obviously let us know if jarkko-master/sgx is not where the action is
at or if you would like us to move forward with alternative testing.

Regression traces follow:
