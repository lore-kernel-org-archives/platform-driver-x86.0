Ok. It means that at least original Alex patch needs to be=20
reworked (so we will do not see duplicate events problem and=20
problem described in previous email).

But my other question is... If ARBT(1) is called then it disables=20
BIOS support for managing radio devices on your laptop. Why we=20
need patch which disabling useful functionality (=3D ability to=20
disable wifi rfkill)? We still do not have patch which can=20
correctly set rfkill state by software on laptops of your fn key=20
type.
