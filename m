Personally I do not like this new sysfs attribute...

Now when somebody look at /sys/class/leds/<something>/, the first thing=20
which say would be:

"What the hell, why there are two files (brightness and=20
current_brightness) for changing LED level? And which should I use?"

If I understood correctly we need to handle two things:

1) Provide poll() for userspace when LED level is changed (either by HW
   or other user call)

2) Deal with fact that on _some_ hardware, special key is hardwired to
   change LED level

So why for 1) we cannot use existing sysfs file "brightness"? I do not=20
see any problem with it.

And for 2) we even do not know on which machines is such hardwired=20
feature enabled. Yes, on _some_ (not *all*) Dell machines there is Fn=20
key combination which changes level of one LED device. But kernel does=20
not know if hardware on which is running is doing such thing or not.=20
Some machines do not have to have key for such action and we do not know=20
it.

And what about situation when somebody wants to configure e.g. mouse=20
movement (or keypress) trigger to enable/disable LED device (which=20
belongs to keyboard brightness)? In this case user explicitly know that=20
his Fn+Space change level of LED device, so can be careful to not press=20
it. With your read-only trigger you basically disable such (I think=20
useful) feature.
