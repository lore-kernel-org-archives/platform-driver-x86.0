I heard that we can install the driver in virtual machine for study its behavior.
But dont know the detail - it means we need to have a pseudo device there.

Sorry, I do not know much about Windows.

The no_bt_rfkill is a stopgap for dual OS user. when BT is default on, user
still have the BT sw rfkill registered as hci0. when BT is defualt off, user
can re-insert module with no_bt_rfkill=0.

Sorry I do not get the point of a manual call. Could you explain more on this?

ideapad_rfk_set is called when user update /sys/class/rfkill/rfkill?/state and
ideapad_sync_rfk_state is called when user touch the hw rfkill switch.
