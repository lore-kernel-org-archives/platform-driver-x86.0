Hi Joey,

If you look in /proc/bus/input/devices do you see rfkill-input as
actually bound to the device that has KEY_BLUETOOTH?

Since it is atkbd that is emitting KEY_BLUETOOTH and this key is not in
the default keymap I think you must be loading Acer-specific keymap via
udev or some other mechanism, and I guess stumbling upon a deficiency in
input layer: we do not re-match devices after changing keymap. So if
rfkill-input was loaded before keymap was altered, then it will not bind
to the keyboard even if you add KE_BLUETOOTH at a later time. Fixing
this is something that was on my TODO list for a while now...

Thaks.
