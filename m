The only difference between 2.6.32.15 and Ubuntu Lucid wrt dell-wmi.c is 
this:

43,46d42
< /* Temporary workaround until the WMI sysfs interface goes in.
<    Borrowed from acer-wmi */
< MODULE_ALIAS("dmi:*:*Dell*:*:");
<

I wonder about input event filtering? There are substantial differences 
in drivers/input/input.c.
