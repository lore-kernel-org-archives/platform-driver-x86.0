Me neither.

So what do you suggest now?

Having one file where it would be defined is a bad idea for you.
And maintaining copy of same array in two different files in two
different subsystems is something which I cannot guarantee.

Therefore the current patch is the best approach. No shared file with
shared array/table and also no copy of that array in two different
subsystems.
