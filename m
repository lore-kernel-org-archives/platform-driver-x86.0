Wolfram, will you be making an immutable i2c branch available for us to merge
into our platform driver x86 for-next branch in order to apply this patch?

Alternatively you could send this in on our behalf, but that complicates any
fixes between now and rc1 for this new driver. We'd prefer the immutable branch
and pull this in ourselves.

Either way,
