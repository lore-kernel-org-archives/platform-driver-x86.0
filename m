These patches are made against current mainline kernel and also available at
  git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ikepanhc/ideapad-laptop.git for-upstream

Once the rfkill of a laptop is set to block, it is no way to unblock with Linux
without driver. Thanks for David Woodhouse wrote the first driver solving this.

But the \_SB_.GECN and \_SB_.DECN are only available on Lenovo ideapad S10-3.
Using EC command to control rf/camera power is better because I believe every
ideapads which has VPC2004 device in its DSDT has this common method.

This driver is tested on Lenovo ideapad B550 and ideapad S10-3 and also tested
by Mario 'BitKoenig' Holbe on Lenovo ideapad S12-VIA.

Changes after last posted:
 * Add schedule() to yield processor when waiting EC.
 * Using time_before() to check timeout.
 * Maximun waiting for EC execution increasing to 100ms in case that we have a
   slow EC.
 * Add parameter: no_bt_rfkill for not setup bluetooth rfkill.

Next step for this driver:
 * Hotkey enablement.

Ike Panhc (9):
  ideapad: add ACPI helpers
  ideapad: check VPC bit before sync rfkill hw status
  ideapad: make sure we bind on the correct device
  ideapad: use return value of _CFG to tell if device exist or not
  ideapad: use EC command to control camera
  ideapad: rewrite the hw rfkill notify
  ideapad: rewrite the sw rfkill set
  ideapad: Change the driver name to ideapad-laptop
  ideapad: Add param: no_bt_rfkill
