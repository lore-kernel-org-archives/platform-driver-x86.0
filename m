TXT driver can be used to access below resources:
  - TXT config space
  - SMX parameter

Intel TXT (Trusted Execution Technology) will provide higher
assurance of system configuration and initial state as well as
data reset protection. It also helps solve real end user concerns
about having confidence that their hardware is running the VMM
or kernel that it was configured with, especially since they may
be responsible for providing such assurances to VMs and services
running on it.

See Documentation/intel_txt.txt for more information about
Intel TXT.

Intel TXT configuration registers are a subset of chipset registers.
These chipset registers that interact with SMX are accessed from two
regions of memory, which represent the public and private configuration
spaces, by system software using memory read/write protocols.

Safer Mode Extensions (SMX) provide a processor's programming
interface in an Intel TXT platform for system software to establish
a measured environment within the platform to support trust decisions
by end users.
