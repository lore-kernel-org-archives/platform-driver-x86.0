Hi all,

The recent conversion to the PM handling based on struct dev_pm_ops
uncovered some code that is not used for CONFIG_PM_SLEEP unset, which
results in a number of new copiler warning.

Admittedly, I should have spotted those places before, but anyway
patches fixing those for ACPI, platform/x86 and tpm_tis follow.

Thanks,
Rafael
