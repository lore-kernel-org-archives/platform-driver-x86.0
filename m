Rebuilt with CONFIG_DEBUG_FS, CONFIG_PM_DEBUG, CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG, 
CONFIG_AMD_MP2_STB, CONFIG_X86_MSR and a larger log buffer, and removed 
CONFIG_RANDSTRUCT so the kernel is no longer tainted. Prerequisites now 
pass. Run below is with all 24 CPUs online, IOMMU enabled, no IOMMU boot 
parameters.

amd-s2idle prerequisites:

   AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX PRO 370 w/ Radeon 890M (family 1a model 24)
   DMI data was not setup
   Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)
   Kernel 6.18.51
   Battery BAT0 (SMP 5B11H56412) is operating at 102.35% of design
   ASPM policy set to 'default'
   GPIO driver `pinctrl_amd` available
   PMC driver `amd_pmc` loaded (Program 11 Firmware 93.23.0)
   PCIe hotplug driver `pciehp` loaded
   USB3 driver `xhci_hcd` bound to 0000:c5:00.4, 0000:c7:00.0, 
0000:c7:00.3, 0000:c7:00.4
   USB4 driver `thunderbolt` bound to 0000:c7:00.5, 0000:c7:00.6
   System is configured for s2idle
   GPU driver `amdgpu` bound to 0000:c5:00.0
   PC6 and CC6 enabled
   SMT enabled
   IOMMU properly configured
   ACPI FADT supports Low-power S0 idle
   Logs are provided via dmesg, timestamps may not be accurate over 
multiple cycles
   LPS0 _DSM enabled
   WLAN driver `mt7925e` bound to 0000:c2:00.0
   No RTC device found, please manually wake system

Two notes on the remaining warnings. The DMI one is a false positive 
here: this kernel has CONFIG_DMIID=n so /sys/class/dmi/id does not 
exist, but DMI itself is scanned normally ("DMI: LENOVO 
21RXS07D00/21RXS07D00, BIOS R2XET40W (1.20 ) 05/26/2026") and 
dmi_check_system() quirks do apply. The RTC one is real: this machine 
reports "rtc_cmos PNP0B00:00: error -ENXIO: IRQ index 0 not found", so 
RTC_FEATURE_ALARM is cleared and there is no wakealarm to program. 
use_acpi_alarm_quirks() should match here (AMD, BIOS year 2026, HPET 
enabled) but the feature bit is cleared purely on IRQ absence, so it 
cannot take effect.

I cannot give you a report file for the failing configuration, because 
the tool writes it after resume and the machine never resumes. The 
kernel log also cannot be captured past the freezer: dmesg -w over ssh 
stops as soon as user space is frozen. All I get is:

   PM: suspend entry (s2idle)
   Filesystems sync: 0.011 seconds

There is no serial port on this machine and no panic, so pstore captures 
nothing either.

What is more useful is a /sys/power/pm_test bisect, all with 24 CPUs and 
the IOMMU enabled:

   freezer     pass
   devices     pass, every device callback returned 0, resume of devices 
complete after 206.186 msecs
   platform    pass, resume of devices complete after 261.566 msecs

processors and core are rejected for s2idle ("PM: Unsupported test mode 
for suspend to idle, please choose none/freezer/devices/platform"), so 
platform is the deepest available.

platform covers the ACPI platform prepare including LPS0 _DSM entry and 
returns before entering the idle loop. So the entire software suspend 
path is clean: freezing, every device suspend/resume callback, and the 
platform prepare all work. The only step not covered by pm_test is 
entering and exiting hardware s0i3, and that is where it hangs.

Combined with "PC6 and CC6 enabled" passing, the cores are able to reach 
the required C-state. And amd_iommu=off with the same 24 CPUs makes the 
machine wake normally, while intremap=off, iommu=pt and 
amd_iommu_intr=legacy all still hang.

Baseline before the failing suspend, from debugfs:

   /sys/kernel/debug/amd_pmc/s0ix_stats
     S0ix Entry Time: 0
     S0ix Exit Time: 0
     Residency Time: 0
   /sys/kernel/debug/amd_pmc/smu_fw_info
     Table Version: 0
     Hint Count: 0
     Last S0i3 Status: Unknown/Fail

I will boot amd_iommu=off next and send the same counters plus a full 
amd-s2idle report from a cycle that actually resumes, so you can see 
whether that configuration reaches hardware sleep or is simply failing 
to get there in a way that happens to stay recoverable.
