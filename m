Hi Darren,

Sorry for the way late reply, I had to go out of town in a hurry.

Alright, will do whenever we reach an agreement below.

Yeah, its the latter, the "SPFC" method is specific to TOS1900 devices.

All of the TOS1900 support the Toshiba specific backlight read-only,
and that test is just to get those implementations where the AML
code doesn't check for read/write registers, so far I've identified three
series of laptops with this issue (all Qosmios), X500, X505 and X75-A
(and there might be more around).

We could dissable backlight on all TOS1900 or add those three models
to the (growing) DMI list on video.c, but of course, I would like to keep
the code in-house, but that's just me :-)
