ok, let's forget about gnome popups for a moment, can you try using the
sysfs files directly?

i.e.:
$ grep .  /sys/class/backlight/sony/*
/sys/class/backlight/sony/actual_brightness:206
/sys/class/backlight/sony/bl_power:0
/sys/class/backlight/sony/brightness:206
/sys/class/backlight/sony/max_brightness:206
grep: /sys/class/backlight/sony/power: Is a directory
grep: /sys/class/backlight/sony/subsystem: Is a directory
/sys/class/backlight/sony/type:platform

$ echo 150 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/sony/brightness
150

Could you then include (in your mail please) the dmesg output after
this test?

Thanks!
