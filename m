Just tried this on my X1 Carbon (i7-3667U Ivy Lake):

# cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_stop_threshold
100
# cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_start_threshold
100

That doesn't seem to make any sense.  Is my battery somehow reporting
false values here?  Any way to cross check these values?
