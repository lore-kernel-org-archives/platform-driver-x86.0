I looked a bit through the patch and I see that it is restricted
to MM and (forgotten the model number). I have a VGN-Z11 which has
also a turn on/off optical drive, a shock sensor etc.

I would be interested in trying out some of these new things and see if
they can work in the Z11, too.

(btw, I also take care for the sony-laptop-zseries variant of the
kernel module where you can turn off and on the nvidia card,
and also the led of the speed-stamina switch is controlled. After
I have tried your patches I will try to merge my patches back into
yours.)

Best wishes

Norbert
