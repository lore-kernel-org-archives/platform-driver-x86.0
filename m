Looks like not. That decompressed output seems to be not compressed
anymore. Just use same magic header.

Now it looks like binary representation of MOF. Where structures and
types are encoded by binary sequences.

Whole BMF file should be on stdin (with that 16 bytes header) and is
decompressed on stdout.

So... it is not Quantum compression. BMF content does not pass Quantum
header where is number of files (too huge).
