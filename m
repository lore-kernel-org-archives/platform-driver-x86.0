Alex, am I right that your dell-wireless.c do nothing for laptops=20
with HW switch (when CRBT returns 2 or 3)?

If yes, then for these laptops we do not need dell-wireless.c and=20
my dell-rbtn.c is better.

Yes, sure.

Do you know what should ARBT method do?

Until we would know how to *properly* set soft rfkill state and=20
what ARBT is doing on more machines, I'm not going to update my=20
dell-rbtn.c (as it is for now complete).

Darren, I think that if we do not solve problem with duplicate=20
key events (in dell-wireless.c) we should postpone these patches=20
to later kernel version. It is better to not have such regression=20
as it confuse software like NetworkManager which is widely used.

>=20

Check if wlan key is reported via WMI or AT Keyboard also without=20
dell-wireless.c.

Check if dell-rbtn.c show correct hard rfkill state (on all=20
tested machines) when pressing wlan key more times (or switching=20
HW-slide switch).
