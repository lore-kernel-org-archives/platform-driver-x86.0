This patch-set try to support physically hot-plug/unplug
a cpu automatically, that is:
if you offline a cpu, it will automatically actually remove
a cpu, and if you hot-plug a cpu, then it will online this
cpu automatically.
so, offline is just like eject, but eject attribute seems not
available since recent kernel(can't figure out when), with
this driver, if allowed, it will trigger a eject cpu process.
and for automatically online, it was said there are objections,
don't know the reason, so, send this patch-set boldly.

of course, this approach is for QEMU 's hotplug cpu emulation 
only, but not limited, if someone like to explore ec space to
implment cpu hot-plug/unplug for real platform please
feel free to continue.
