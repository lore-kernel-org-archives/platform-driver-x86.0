Good one, that will allow for a nice cleanup of the callers, we can make
i2c_acpi_new_device return -EPROBE_DEFER when the i2c_acpi_find_adapter_by_handle()
call fails, which is exactly the case when we want to defer.

One problem is that i2c_new_device() currently simply returns NULL on all
errors. Andy, you could take a look how much work it is to make that return
an ERR_PTR too, or just check its return value and return ERR_PTR(-ENXIO) if
it fails for now...

Regards,

Hans
