On boards where the _STA for INT0002 returns 0, that patchset
is needed for the driver to bind to the device, so yes it has
a functional requirement on some (most it seems) board, but
only at run-time, it can be merged independently.

The name is e.g. _E02 or _L02 so 5 bytes including the NUL is enough :)

Agreed, will fix for v2.

We enable runtime pm for this device, at which point these
are mandatory.
