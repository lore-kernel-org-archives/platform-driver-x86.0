I don't like the idea of touching vendor-screwup-land like thermal
zones, especially when thinkpads *already* have thermal zones and they
must come from the very same sensors...

This would need a lot of careful studying and planning.

It varies with each model.  You can map it out with better precision by
using a cold spray while doing an "open-heart" surgery on the thinkpad.
I kid you not, that's how they were mapped for some models.

Look for information about this in thinkwiki:
http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Thermal_Sensors#ThinkPad_X60

The battery-pack-related sensor that is stuck at 50°C is something the
Lenovo Yamato labs guys wouldn't be clear about.  They told me to look
at what the Windows drivers do, but that would require (1) Windows in
the first place, and (2) clean room reverse engineering protocols.

Well, that first sensor getting to 100°C is your CPU for sure.

Hey, I *did* properly document that driver, and the documentation is
even mostly up-to-date...  Please refer to
Documentation/laptops/thinkpad-acpi.txt in the kernel tree.
