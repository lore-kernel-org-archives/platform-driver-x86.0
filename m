Hi Shuah,
thanks for your reply.

In this case, the SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS macro handles the case internally - i.e. 
no matter whether CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is set or not, the correct structure is set 
up and thus no ifdef needed.

Hmm,
at first I thought that would be a good idea, however scrolling to the git 
history I found:

commit 07368d32f1a67e797def08cf2ee3ea1647b204b6
Author: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
Date:   Thu Aug 9 23:00:35 2012 +0200

    tpm_tis / PM: Fix unused function warning for CONFIG_PM_SLEEP
    
    According to a compiler warning, the tpm_tis_resume() function is not
    used for CONFIG_PM_SLEEP unset, so add a #ifdef to prevent it from
    being built in that case.
    
    Signed-off-by: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>

So removing it there would effectively revert the patch and re-enable the 
warning.

Yes.

Maybe the better idea is to add the correct CONFIG_PM ifdefs for all code 
paths related to PM.
Or leave the CONFIG_PM for tpm_tis_resume as it is.


Thanks,
Peter
