OK, I'll make one (based on 4.10 final - the patch should apply cleanly
there and there is no point of forcing anyone's workflow to use kernel
in the beginning of stabilization cycle).

As to whether there are PDx86 patches - I hope Michał will supply them
;) I'll take care of the 2 instances in drivers/input/misc.

Thanks.
