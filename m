OK, I played around a little more and can now  reproduce what your
seeing.  What I need to do is boot such that eeepc-laptop is not
loaded.

Thanks for mentioning exact device name /dev/input/event4.  Its
interesting that mine is registered so late at /dev/input/event7.

input: Video Bus as
/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXSYBUS:00/PNP0A08:00/LNXVIDEO:00/input/input7
ACPI: Video Device [VGA] (multi-head: yes  rom: no  post: no)

If I bootup with no options then eeepc-laptop is not loaded.  In this
case, I do see events on input7 (I previously stated that I didn't.
Sorry about that).  In this case, it appears that gnome-power-manager
gets involved (I see the percentage bar updates) and the screen does
those funky non-linear updates.

If I bootup with just acpi_osi=3D"!Windows 2009" then eeepc-laptop does
get loaded.  In this case, the input7 still gets created but no events
are sent on it.  Also, an input9 device is created for eeepc-laptop
and brightness keys are NOT sent over it as well.  In this case, the
brightness levels are linear as long as I use Fn-keys only (not the
/sys/* interface).

And finally, if I boot with both acpi_osi=3D"!Windows 2009" and
acpi_backlight=3Dvendor then I  see events on eeepc-laptop input9 and
gnome-power-manager seems to get involved as well but this time the
display is updated linearly.

So in summary, I think it tells me this:

1) If ACPI only is involved then brightness controls work fine.  By
ACPI only, I mean using Fn-keys for brightness and doing something to
prevent software like gnome-power-manager from getting involved with
/sys/* interface.
2) Anything that writes to /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness
works non-linearly.
3) If you keep software from writing to
/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness then brightness changes
made with Fn-keys do not get reflected into any of those acpi_video0
files.  Writing to those files controls brightness non-linearly and
show up when you read back.
4) If I use acpi_backlight=3Dvendor then I can access
/sys/class/backlight/eeepc/brightness and it works linearly.  Things
like gnome-power-manager work good with this interface.
