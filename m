I went ahead and tested thermistors against their potential names.
Finding are available here:
https://github.com/alexVinarskis/linux-x1e80100-dell-tributo/blob/master/de=
ll-xps13-9345-ec.pdf

TL;DR: with your correction of AMUX GPIOs to 1, 2 instead of 3, 4 most=20
of the proposed labels are correct, except for left charging controller.
This thermistor is quite far away such that IMO it cannot be associated
with the charger. This perfectly explains the difference in heating up
rate we both observed.

I will adjust labels, address rest of the comments and respin series
shortly.

Alex
