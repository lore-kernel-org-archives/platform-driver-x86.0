udev does have some per-model stuff for the Vaio's.

Doesn't work right because the scancodes reported the sony-laptop driver 
are not the right ones.

(sony-laptop sends its "event" code as the scancode, but to change the 
keymap you have to use the index in the sony_laptop_input_keycode_map 
table.  I have posted one patch for this which makes the scancodes at 
least consistent but I think I'll do another that makes them be the same 
as what current udev thinks they should be.  I'll have that ready this 
evening I thing - have to work now :-( )
