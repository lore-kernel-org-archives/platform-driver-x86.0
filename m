If "inhibit" means "do not generate any events going forward", then
this must also cover wakeup events, so I agree.

Sounds reasonable to me.

I agree that the kernel is the right place to handle this, but it
requires some extra knowledge about dependencies between devices.

It'd be kind of like power resources in ACPI, so for each state of a
"master" device (in principle, there may be more states of it than
just two) there would be a list of "dependent" intput devices that
need to be inhibited when the "master" device goes into that state.
