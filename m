I don't really see that much difference in the complexity.

The driver has SGX_POWER_LOST_ENCLAVE for ioctls and it deletes the TCS
entries.

This is not about EPC. It is already dealt by the driver. I'm concerned
about the MSR cache as it would mess up.

But I guess this logic is part of the KVM code anyway now that I think
more of it.
