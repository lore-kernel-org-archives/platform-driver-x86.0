__free() = NULL is not that hard to catch during review (or even in
code already in-tree), have done that dozens of times myself by now.
Checkpatch, too, should be able to catch that easily, if it doesn't 
already.

None of those cases I've commented on had a bug, so it was just for 
teaching submitters & readers of that code the correct __free() pattern.
I think the concern is largely overblown given how rare actual bugs are 
even if the wrong pattern is used. Put that to contrast to memleaks found 
on our rollback paths, __free() looks a clear win despite very rare to 
occur caveats.

Given what I've seen, I'd say on dangerous level __free() = NULL is 
somewhere around using MAGIC_SIZE_DEFINE instead sizeof(*obj) when doing 
mem allocs. It usually isn't buggy even if we don't want to teach people 
to use it.

Besides, it was actually Rafael himself who brought the unsafe pattern 
into this discussion (I immediately noticed the problem but since it was 
not an actual patch, I didn't raise a concern). Sakari's patch did use the 
correct pattern (and if it wouldn't have done so, there would have been a 
review comment from me ;-)). In my reply to Rafael, I intentionally left 
the right side open with "= ..." to not place that NULL there.

That works too in this case, yes.
