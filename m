Yep, that's an important point (not breaking the API/ABI).

I think this patch should keep the original logic, as this is supposed
to be a refactor only. If we decide to remove the check, we should to
it in a separate patch, to make it clear for someone looking at the
history later.

I'm fine with removing the type check (in a separate patch), but I
don't see much gain in doing so.
