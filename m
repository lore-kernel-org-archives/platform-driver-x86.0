Do that first, get it merged, and then let's work on the second part.
The patch for that will be much more obvious as to what you are
attempting to do.

What is not in the existing interface?  And as this is a thermal device,
why can't you add them there?

So any application will have to know all of the device-specific
attributes?  That totally defeats the purpose of a generic api that the
kernel is providing.  You are creating device-specific apis that will
not work over the long-run (i.e. next 5-10 years.)  Please don't do that
unless you have exhausted _all_ other alternatives.

So, get your first driver accepted, using the in-kernel thermal api, and
then, if you still feel you wish to do device-specific extensions, we
can discuss that then.
