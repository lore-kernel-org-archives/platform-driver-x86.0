(Actually, "::wifi" is super confusing, I'd expect that to be a led
that blinks when wifi is active.)

Well... "airplane" is quite confusing. I'd we use "rfkill" for
disabling radios, and I believe we should stick with that.

But small problem might be polarity. You may need both "::rfkill" and
"::not-rfkill".
