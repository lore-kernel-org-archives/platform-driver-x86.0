I'm not neither experienced nor the maintainer but I'll give my two cents.

Here there is something I don't understand, since the _BCM method stores 
the brightness level into an EC register (apparently which one depends 
whether the notebook is on battery or not, if BNCM is enabled), but no 
GFX related methods are then called. The fact that _BQC returns an 
updated value proves that it works, but looking at your DSDT I'd say 
that no change is indeed applied. Are you experiencing the same issue 
under Windows?

Not necessarily.

In your laptop SBRT/GBRT methods use zero based values, so -1 is a 
reasonable value. But why are you always getting -1 (especially if the 
LCD brightness is maximized)? Maybe the if statement "If (^^EC0.BNEN)" 
is false, but why?

Using the sony-laptop provided backlight device, try to dump the EC 
registers before and after changing the brightness value. You can use 
"ectool" or sysfs (depending on your kernel configuration).
