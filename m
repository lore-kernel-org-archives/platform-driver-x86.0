No, that is not the case. I can play with `rfkill list` immediately aft=
er I=20
press the HW bluetooth switch and show that hci0 is not there (still=20
unregistered) while acer-bluetooth is already "unblocked" - I've tried =
to run=20
`rfkill list` repeatedly manually from console immediately after I pres=
sed the=20
HW BT switch and acer-bluetooth was "unblocked" several runs while the =
hci0=20
wasn't there. When hci0 appeared, it was "blocked".

As I wrote, I didn't find anything changing the global state, which is =
actually=20
used to "block" the newly appearing hci0 (in the rfkill_sync_work metho=
d). It=20
looks like the global state is just "blocked" forever - and it is "bloc=
ked" as=20
a side-effect of the call to rfkill_init_sw_state (changes permanent=3D=
true) and=20
then call to rfkill_register from the acer-wmi driver. I can verify thi=
s in=20
the following days (that the global state stays the same all the time).

Cheers,
