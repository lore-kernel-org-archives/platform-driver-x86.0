Scratch #2 from the arguments since it's include/linux/platform_data that we're
talking about here.

You're understanding is correct. We're just applying different values to the
respective merits of each argument.

The options are:

a) include/linux/x86
b) include/linux/platform_data/x86

In my opinion, a) looks like architecture and would be difficult to distinguish
from arch/x86/include. b) on the other hand clearly notes that it is for
platform specific information. If it was platform instead of platform_data, that
would be even better, but that could be a later change. But I think the
confusion over x86 arch in a) is worse than the more subtle (in my opinion)
distinction between "platform" and "platform_data".

I would want x86 maintainer approval before adding a), while b) I'm happy to add
ourselves - and we already have agreement from tglx on that.

To move forward, let's go with b). The new x86 directory clearly separates out
content which will make it trivial to move later if the need arises.
