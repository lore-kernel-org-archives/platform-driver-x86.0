I'm not going to make the call on what firmware may do when it enters
suspend. Even if it's not supposed to do anything, it still might.

tick_freeze does through timekeeping_suspend or tick_suspend_local
depending on whether it's the last CPU to freeze or not.

tick_freeze in tick-common.c calls the tick suspend code.

If I get rid of passing in the cpu id, the only thing left to check
seems to be making sure that tick_clear_freeze_event is called on the
same CPU as tick_set_freeze_event. Am I missing something? I'll add
Documentation.
