I tried exactly that, and one could say that it was 50% successful. One
of the hotkeys triggers an EC event 0x95, which should lead to the following
ACPI call chain:

// upper hotkey (touchpad)
Method (_Q95, 0, NotSerialized)
{
	Store (0x95, P80H)
	\_SB.WMI2.CMD3 (0x86)
}

Method (CMD3, 1, NotSerialized)
{
	CMD0 (0x19, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, Arg0)
}

Method (CMD0, 5, Serialized)
{
	If (LAnd (ERQ0, LEqual (Arg2, 0x01)))
	{
		Store (Arg0, EVID)
		Store (Arg1, ACID)
		Store (Arg4, DA01)
		Notify (\_SB.WMI2, 0x80)
	}
	Else
	{
		Acquire (MCD0, 0xFFFF)
		UWED (Arg0, Arg1, Arg4)
		Release (MCD0)
	}
}

So it would be all joy and happiness if it weren't for the fact that
ERQ0 is initialized to zero and is never changed anywhere else.. I'll
give the VPC0._CFG method a try later today and see if that changes
anything.

What's also confusing is that while there's an EC register (0xE6) which
nicely reflects all of the hotkeys' state as a bitmask, one of them
doesn't trigger an EC event. I'm reluctant to just write stuff to the EC
registers, but maybe one of you can make some sense of the attached
hexdump - it says "SANYO" somewhere in there, does that ring a bell?

Since I've seen that lenovo-sl-laptop also just uses polling at 5 Hz to
handle the hotkeys, I'm sort of leaning towards that solution now..
