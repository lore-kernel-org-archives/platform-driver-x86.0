I've done similar checks on the NB505, no events.

In the DSDTs I've inspected there is an EC query method that looks like
it handles events for the hotkeys, but I've never been able to find
anything that will cause the GPE to trigger when the hotkeys are
pressed.

Interestingly, I also saw that the Windows hotkey driver for the NB505
logs some messages that indicate it's also filtering Fn key presses, an=
d
I also found that the binary contains the NTFY string. That's not proof
of anything, but it does suggest that the Windows driver might be doing
something similar to support hotkeys. Which makes me wonder if the GPE
works at all.

The NB505 is very similar. We might be able to get by without NTFY if
all it was doing was providing the notification, but as you can see it
also sets a flag that's needed to read the hotkey event with the INFO
method.

The NB505 (which is what I've been testing with) requires this as well.
