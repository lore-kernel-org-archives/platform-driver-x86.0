This and the other 2 are queued to for-review. They will remain there for a few
days to give others a chance to review. After that, I will provide a thorough
review and move them into for-next for 4.3

They do pass all my preliminary tests, checkpatch, build, and ninja-check.

As this is the first series that I've received since enabling a lot of new
automation, I wanted to say thanks for clean series that is ready review. Nice.
