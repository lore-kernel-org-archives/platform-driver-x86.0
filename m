I agree as I see no reason for this patch series to be backported.

Ah, okay, so you are using the Debian/Ubuntu build method.  The messages
it spits out are correct as the purpose of this series is to remove
dell-led and create dell-wmi-led.  However, I have never compiled a
kernel using the Debian/Ubuntu way, so I am unable to give you any tips
for getting rid of the "Missing modules" error message.

Sure, no rush, though before you start bisecting, please check whether
CONFIG_DELL_LAPTOP is enabled in your kernel configuration for 4.9.

CONFIG_DELL_SMBIOS is not set in that .config.  That prevents you from
enabling CONFIG_LEDS_DELL_NETBOOKS, which is required for the microphone
mute LED to work without this patch series applied.

My remark regarding CONFIG_DELL_LAPTOP also applies to 4.10-rc8 with
this patch series applied.

Thanks again for your work on this,
