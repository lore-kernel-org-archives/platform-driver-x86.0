Ok, new idea how about we modify the code in acpi_device_enumeration_by_parent
to instead of looking at a HID list, to simply count if there is more then
1 I2cSerialBus resource and if that is the case enumerate the device as
a platform device for i2c-multi-instantiate.c to handle. This means that
we will only change the way how the BOSC0200 is enumerated on the
Yoga 11e and not elsewhere.

This is somewhat likely to trigger a regression somewhere, but we should
be able to fix those regressions by adding the necessary info to
i2c-multi-instantiate.c.  Then it could still be a problem because of
the modalias changing for an i2c device from some other DSDT which we
are not aware of yet, but that only is a problem if the modalias is
used in hwdb. The actual driver for the hardware should bind to the
new modalias too and if not we can fix that.

I believe the amount of devices which turn out to have more then 1
I2cSerialBus resource will be small and the set of devices which are already
working somehow (because the 1st resource is the one we care about) and also
have a hwdb entry will likely be very small and we can help users who
hit this combo by providing hwdb patches.

...

Hmm, a quick random spot check of a few of the too many DSTDs I have
turns out that at least the INT34D3 (Intel Whiskey Cove PMIC) will
be bitten by this. This is trivial to fix though.

And another one is the "CPLM3218" ambient light sensor, which does
not have an in tree driver, but there is an out of tree one which
is on my list to upstream...

This will also cause us to stop generating i2c-clients for some of
the camera sensors on BYT/CHT since some list multiple (some up to 10 ???)
addresses I guess this is for some sorta auto-probe function in
the windows drivers.

TL;DR: the idea of just checking for multiple I2cSerialBus resources
in a single acpi_fwnode is interesting, but might cause more problems
then I would hope.

Hans
