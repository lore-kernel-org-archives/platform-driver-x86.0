It seems to me the question is primarily over whether or not the interf=
ace
protects a shared resource (a common buffer) or if that buffer should b=
e
independent for every caller.

I favor minimal and incremental change and avoiding complexity where it=
 is not
needed. I don't believe there is anything performance critical in any o=
f these
paths, e.g. nothing requires a better response time than about 100ms an=
d nothing
is likely to occur at a frequency above 10Hz or so.

Assuming the above is an accurate view, I don't see any reason to go be=
yond the
minimal change to the existing SMBIOS code to make it a usable API. If =
the need
arises, we can always make such optimizations and performance improveme=
nts
later. This is an internal API and we can change it whenever we need to=
 so long
as we update the call sites.

Does anyone have a compelling reason to look for changes to the v2 subm=
itted by
