Yeah, it really should. Thanks for spotting.

Yes, of course this would need to be moved outside of the region where
pre-emption is disabled.

I have assignment in my local tree but for some reason it was not
squashed to this commit :-/

The name of the local variable is probably a bit misleading but also
cached values are compared in the loop.

No it cannot.

Yes.

I think Sean's suggestion to update cache on SGX_INVALID_TOKEN is way to
go in this and instead of fixing this I'll change the code to use that
as a measure to update the cache.
