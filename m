We know that Windows 8 graphics drivers don't use the ACPI interface,
and that systems change their behaviour as a result, in some cases with
absolutely no way for the ACPI interface could possibly work. I haven't
seen any cases where that's obviously true for any non-Windows 8
systems. EC interfaces that don't work are often due to Linux leaving
the hardware in a state other than the one expected by the firmware. We
shouldn't assume that it's the same issue until we've investigated
further.
