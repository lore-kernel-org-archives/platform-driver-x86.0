Hi,

I know that some time ago the UEFI installation could brick Samsung
laptops and one way to prevent this was to patch the kernel disabling
the samsung-laptop module case it detect that was running in UEFI
mode.
As far as I know Samsung already fixed the firmware and other more
permanent fixes were applied to the kernel.

For what I found from an internet search, the reason for keeping this
blacklist is because this module still can cause some issues to the
laptop.

This is a bit frustrating, as similar Samsung Settings applications
works perfectly under UEFI in Windows.

So, I would like to ask you this: since it already passed some time
from the initial issue and the kernel has some many Samsung employed
contributors is there any plans to fix this module and re-enable it in
UEFI?

Regards,
Rafael
