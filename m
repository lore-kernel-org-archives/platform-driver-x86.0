I can accept with this solution (no trigger, event on new sysfs file=20
which returns current/actual brightness state, new sysfs file only for=20
devices which can report brightness state).

But I'm not sure if it is really fixing that original problem with high=20
power usage...

As wrote in some previous emails, consider "actual_brightness" sysfs=20
name which is already used for this purpose by backlight subsystem --=20
because for consistency. backlight devices have: actual_brightness,=20
brightness, max_brightness.
