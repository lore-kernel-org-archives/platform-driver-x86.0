Hi Bjorn,

first of all sorry for the delay, had been busy with other stuff in the 
last few weeks.

Yes, the original idea was that the driver calling this knows that the 
BARs will be changed for the bridge it belongs to.

But you're right. I've changed it in the way that our device driver will 
release all resource first and then call the function to resize its BAR.

The function will return an error in the next version of the patch if 
the bridge BAR which needs to be moved for this is still used by child 
resources.

I've tried it, but this actually doesn't seem to work.

At least on the board I've tried pci_disable_device() doesn't clear the 
PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY bit, it just clears the master bit.

Additional to that the power management reference counting 
pci_disable_device() and pci_enable_device() doesn't look like what I 
want for this functionality.

How about the driver needs to disabled memory decoding itself before 
trying to resize anything?

Makes sense, changed.

No, we need to restore the original size of the resource before trying 
the recovery code when something goes wrong.

I will address all other comments in the next version of the patch as well.
