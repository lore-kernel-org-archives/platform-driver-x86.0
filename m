No strong feelings here.  I made it a separate file because
asus-laptop.c is already very large and this was something that could
be fairly easily split out, but obviously it's a really trivial
device.

Just the key device, which exports the single touch area in the corner
of the tablet as KEY_MEDIA.  Some of the other sysfs devices
(bluetooth, display, leds) appear because the methods exist, but
they're stubbed out in the ASL and thus noops.
