Yes, because with triggers and blinking etc. it is impossible for
userspace to continuously monitor brigthness in a way which does not
cause a high system load.

Oh please, we are not going to have this whole ABI discussion again.
I already spend months on this, this ship has long sailed.

It is possible just fine on Dell machines, except that libsmbios changes
will get seen as hardware triggered changes, which in a way they are
as libsmbios is making hardware changes behind the kernels back.

Yes the ABI is in current next, and given that the 4.11 merge-window has
opened this ship has really sailed, also you're making a problem where
there really is none. Now can we please move forward with this ?
