Yes, my answer was only from the power supply subsystem's point of
view, since I do not know much about the thinkpad-acpi and SBS
driver. It seems the SBS driver has already minimal support for
handling platform specifics via the acpi_sbs_dmi_table, though. I
suggest to add a Thinkpad entry and modify the SBS driver, so that
it calls your additional code.

It would be nice, if the Thinkpad specific code could also be used
to add a label to the batteries, so that it's easier to distinguish
batteries in case of multiple ones being available.
