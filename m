I checked the reference source code, my impression is the
TI Dollar Cove and and AXP288 are completely different hardware.

Interestingly via this link I found Intel also published
the TI DCove source in a patch series against an unspecified kernel:
https://github.com/01org/ProductionKernelQuilts
specifically
https://github.com/01org/ProductionKernelQuilts/blob/master/uefi/cht-m1stable/patches/mfd-intel_soc_pmic-add-TI-variant-of-dollar-cove.patch
https://github.com/01org/ProductionKernelQuilts/blob/master/uefi/cht-m1stable/patches/PWRBTN-add-driver-for-TI-PMIC.patch
and some more (the series is quite messy).

For the Asus E200HA I'm not sure if the charger and coulomb
counter drivers are needed since charging just works and
the battery status is reported via ACPI.  It seems these
drivers are only for tablets without ACPI support, right?


Thanks,
Johannes
