Some Fn keys fail to work is probably the result of un-handled events, 
i.e. asus_wmi: Unknown key 7a pressed.

Do you always receive the error messages for each of the Fn-keys that 
fails? I can take a closer look and try to fix each of them. I don't 
have a Asus Zenbook Prime but I can check on other available Asus machines.
