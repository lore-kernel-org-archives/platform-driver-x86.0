I think the blacklist would have to be against specific product names.
=46or example, the MacBook Pro 8,1 has a working acpi_video backlight a=
nd
no gmux_backlight, the 8,2 has both but only gmux_backlight works, and =
I
suspect the 8,3 is the same as the 8,2. We'd probably end up with an
entry in the blacklist for every single model whose acpi_video backligh=
t
doesn't work, adding entries for each new generation of MacBooks.

And if we start blacklisting Macs we'd have start doing it for other
machines too, I guess. From what I've seen, open-ended blacklists like
this get nacked pretty consistently nowadays.
