This is probably wrong - you should be able to just use first_ec
directly rather than probing yourself.

The potential problem here is that there's no guarantee that these event
numbers are stable, and a firmware upgrade could change them. Of course,
that's also true of the EC registers, but we haven't had anyone complain
about the driver suddenly breaking so I'm not hugely enthusiastic about
replacing one fragile but seemingly working method with a fragile but
unproven one.
