I've done some basic testing on my MBP 5,3 (just setting a few 
brightness levels, nothing fancy), and it all works, so feel free to add 
my basic

if you wish. Please let me know if you need testing for future gmux 
features.

A few questions:
     * I'm using nouveau, and with the gmux I have both gmux_backlight 
and nv_backlight (which never worked) in /sys/class/backlight, is this 
expected?
     * Is there anything I can do to test the sysfs backlight interface 
besides setting the levels?
     * Besides the sysfs backlight interface, are there any other 
userspace-visible changes your driver makes that I should test?

Cheers,
