It seems to be ordered alphabetically on the identifier.  Andy, is it
preferred to order defines like this based on resolved numeric order?

There is a lack of apparent consistency in the numeric mapping; for example,
OP_SET_EXT includes the OP_SET bit, but OP_GET_EXT does not include the
OP_GET bit.  However, after inspecting the code I think this is simply
reflecting what the hardware expects.

Given that all other definitions are in terms of BIT(), to my eye "(0 << 0)"
looks as much out of place as plain "0".  However, if the convention in this
case would be to use the former then I have no objections.  I presume the
"(0 << 0)" idea comes from the fact that BIT() ultimately expands to some
form of shift.
