x86's asm/realmode.h, which defines low level structures, variables and
helpers used to bring up APs during SMP boot, ends up getting included in
practically every nook and cranny of the kernel because the address used
by ACPI for resuming from S3 also happens to be stored in the real mode
header, and ACPI bleeds the dependency into its widely included headers.

As a result, modifying realmode.h for even the most trivial change to the
boot code triggers a full kernel rebuild, which is frustrating to say the
least as it some of the most difficult code to get exactly right *and* is
also some of the most functionally isolated code in the kernel.

To break the kernel's widespread dependency on realmode.h, add a wrapper
in the aforementioned ACPI S3 code to access the real mode header instead
of derefencing the header directly in asm/acpi.h and thereby exposing it
to the world via linux/acpi.h.

v2:
  - Rebased on tip/x86/cleanups, commit b74374fef924 ("x86/setup: Enhance
    the comments").
  - Use acpi_get_wakeup_address() as new function name. [Boris and Pavel]
  - Capture acpi_get_wakeup_address() in a local address. [Pavel]
  - Collect acks.  I didn't add Rafael's acks on patches 11 and 12 due to
    the above changes.
  - Explicitly call out the removal of <asm/realmode.h> from <asm/acpi.h>
    in patch 12. [Ingo]
  - Remove superfluous Fixes: tags. [Ard]

Patch Synopsis:
  - Patches 01-09 fix a variety of build errors that arise when patch 12
    drops realmode.h from asm/acpi.h.  Most of the errors are quite absurb
    as they have no relation whatsoever to x86's RM boot code, but occur
    because realmode.h happens to include asm/io.h.

  - Patch 10 removes a spurious include of realmode.h from an ACPI header.

  - Patches 11 and 12 implement the wrapper and move it out of acpi.h.
