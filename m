Hi,

this is patch series I've hacked after useful conversation with
Pavel.  Basically this adds a new LED trigger audio-mute and
audio-micmute, and convert the HD-audio driver and the platform
drivers to use the LED trigger instead of the ugly direct dynamic
symbol binding.

The latest version of patches are found in topic/leds-trigger branch
in my sound git tree.
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound.git

As these are cross-tree patches, the branch above is based cleanly on
v4.20-rc3, so that it can be merged well to multiple trees.

Once after getting the ACK's, I'll add tags and fixate for merges.

This patch series don't include huawei-wmi stuff; so Huawei patches
need rework.  I already have some piece of changes for huawei-wmi, so
please ping me if needed.

I checked briefly on my Dell laptop, and a Thinkpad model.
Wider tests are appreciated, of course.


thanks,

Takashi
