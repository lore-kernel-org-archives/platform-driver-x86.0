I've been think about this, and I'm not sure a notification in the
backlight core makes sense; it seems likely to be limited in use to only
this one use case. Other ideas might be to have an interface to disable
specific backlight devices, or a way to score backlights which leaves
only the "best" device of a given type enabled. Either of these might
affect userspace ABI however.

For now at least if something like this is needed maybe it makes the
most sense to have apple_bl export a function. What about something like
the patch at the end of this message (compile tested only)?

I've been experimenting with a MBP 8,2. This actually has 2 ACPI
backlights, one associated with the radeon GPU (acpi_video0) and the
other with the Intel (acpi_video1).

Turns out that acpi_video0 does work under Windows, and it also works
under Linux depending on how the OS is booted. Doing a boot camp style
boot gives us working acpi_video0 and apple_bl backlights. acpi_video1
doesn't show up in a legacy boot situation, as evaluating _BCM gives an
error.

Under EFI boot, both acpi_video backlights show up but neither works.
The readback verify in apple_bl's probe fails, so that one doesn't show
up. Only gmux_backlight actually works.

Using rEFIt is an oddball case. A BIOS-compatible boot gives non-working
acpi_video and apple_bl backlights. I guess the Apple bootloader must
enable some extra legacy support that rEFIt does not, but I haven't been
able to find any way for us to enable it after Linux has started.
