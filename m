Ack.

But not inhibit, hmm, see below.

So the inhibit() callback triggers the "suspend" behavior ?
But shouldn't drivers which are capable of suspending the device
always do so on close() ?

Since your current proposal also calls close() on inhibit() I
really see little difference between an inhibit() and the last
user of the device closing it and IMHO unless there is a good
reason to actually differentiate the 2 it would be better
to only stick with the existing close() and in cases where
that does not put the device in a low-power mode yet, fix
the existing close() callback to do the low-power mode
setting instead of adding a new callback.

Well, we could make close() return an error and at least in the inhibit()
case propagate that to userspace. I wonder if userspace is going to
do anything useful with that error though...

In my experience errors during cleanup/shutdown are best logged
(using dev_err) and otherwise ignored, so that we try to clean up
as much possible. Unless the very first step of the shutdown process
fails the device is going to be in some twilight zone state anyways
at this point we might as well try to cleanup as much as possible.

So can you explain a bit more about the cases where only having
open/close is not sufficient?  So far I have the feeling that
those are all we need and that we really do not need separate
[un]inhibit callbacks.
