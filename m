Yes, as you point out, this is a doubt for video bus received 0xD0 even=
t
but nobody take care it.

Traced dsdt of EliteBook 8460p from you, the _BCM like this:

    Method (_BCM, 1, Serialized)                /* ATI _BCM, per log, r=
un this _BCM */
    { =20
        Store (\_SB.BCM (Arg0), Local0)         /* set next level, norm=
ally return 0x1 if XP sp2 or later */
        If (Local0)                             /* if XP sp2 or later *=
/
        { =20
            Store (BRID, Local1)
            If (LEqual (SBRV (), 0x00))         /* normally SBRV return=
 1, will not emit SMI */
            { =20
                \_SB.SSMI (0xEA74, 0x04, Local1, 0x00, 0x00)
            }

            Signal (\_SB.BEVT)          /* emit BEVT event, HKFR (Hotke=
yFunctionResponse) waiting it, but why? */
        }
    }

_BCM call SBRV to setup brightness value to variable ABRI:

Method (SBRV, 0, Serialized)            /* call by ATI _BCM */
{ =20
    Store (\_SB.SBRC (), ABRI)          /* SBRC() return the brightness=
 value, why store to ABRI? only used in PEGP.DGFX.AFN2 */
    Or (PSBR, 0x80, PSBR)
    Notify (^, 0xD0)                    /* notify method's parent: PEGP=
=2EDGFX by 0xD0 */
    Return (0x01)                       /* normally return 1 */
}The PEGP.DGFX acpi device was binding to acpi/video driver, the above
ASL code emit a 0xD0 bus event to video.c but cann't process it. Even w=
e
add a new bus event in video.c and generate a acpi event, there still
need another acpi driver should take care it.

I thought this acpi event might need take care by radeon drm, but I am
not good for radeon, need more help.

Per your acpi debug log, the brightness value was changed normally when
you access _BCM:

The brightness values are 11(0x0B) and 72(0x48), that means the BCM
method return a good value and set to ABRI, ABRI waiting the guy who
take the 0xD0 event to read then change brightness.

Another doubt is the latest statement in _BCM, it emit a BEVT event:

Signal (\_SB.BEVT)

Only HKFR(HotkeyFunctionResponse) method is waiting this event, it
should related to how the HP implement brightness function key on
Windows through wmi.

Of course this issue really close related to video driver, even more,
we might need to know hp wmi for how to implement on Windows.

Unfortunately, sorry for I don't have any solution to you, now, I will
continue to trace and find any support from other experts.


Thanks a lot!
