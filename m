If you want different trigger, implement different trigger. If you
want to indicate all but wifi, implement all but wifi, and then
userspace can select it by writing trigger name. If you want complete
userspace control, fine, but we have standard interface and it is not
ioctl.

If you allow userspace to control the LED, well, then the LED may no
longer display the "airplane mode" status. Debugging "wrong trigger is
set" will certainly be less tricky than figuring out that "airplane
mode trigger" is actually "no trigger" based on some obscure ioctls.

Well, you can still revert them before it becomes ABI. David does
not have to pull from you and Linus does not have to pull from
Linus. Besides, the series really should have been Cc-ed to LED
people, too.

Having custom, ioctl-based interface to control the LED is just too
ugly. (And I did not see it documented, which should be another reason
not to merge it.)
