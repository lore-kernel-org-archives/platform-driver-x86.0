OK, fair enough. By the way, I see you are adding some #ifdef
CONFIG_ACPI and stubbing out new functions, but the driver does not
really work without ACPI (acpi_match_device() will fail in this case I
would think and that will cause probe() to abort). So maybe we just add
depends on ACPI to the driver's Kconfig entry?

Thanks.
