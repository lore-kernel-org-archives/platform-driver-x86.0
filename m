That is not truth. X230 is in variant with both Thinklight (light above=20
display) and keyboard backlight. Plus in BIOS it is possible to=20
configure if you want to enable only Thinkligh, only keyboard backlight=20
or both. Probably T430 and other 30s models can be found with both. But=20
I do not own those modules...

So I could guess that it reports event when one of those leds are=20
changed...

If that event is send when either Thinklight or keyb-backlight is=20
changed, should not we inform both led devices about level change? Do=20
you have a chance to test it on notebook with Thinklight?

And funny question is what would happen on those machines which have=20
both Thinklight and keyboard backlight?

Anyway, I would suggest different name, not TP_HKEY_EV_THINKLIGHT as it=20
is not thinklight-only and could be misleading in keyboard backlight=20
context...
