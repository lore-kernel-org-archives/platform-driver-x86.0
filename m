With TS5500 selected, the board comes up, get probed reading the RAM
(from the board code), then registers this GPIO platform device.

GPIO_TS5500 cannot probe the DIO blocks by itself. It needs a board
code to fill and register the corresponding platform device structures.

So a generic x86 kernel will work on the board, but we need TS5500 set
to 'y' in order to have the GPIOs.

As it is an embedded platform, I don't think CONFIG_TS5500 is enabled
on distro kernels.

I hope it's a bit clearer. Let me know what is your advice on this.

Best,
