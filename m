Thanks for checking.

Yes, due to not obvious communication to PMIC. I suppose that the IP
core is quite similar in all of them, the difference is just how OS
and other MCUs in SoC communicate with it.

So, basically what it means that I2C direct communication is prohibited here.

Have no idea.

What that code reminds me is MID family of devices. So, power button
is (reasonable) easy to get support of in that case.
Look into drivers/platform/x86/intel_mid_powerbtn.c. I recently
updated it to support Basin Cove on Intel Edison.
