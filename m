Well, we can remove the thinkpad-acpi /proc interface as far as I'm
concerned, and that would do away with the use of BACKLIGHT_UPDATE_SYSFS by
thinkpad-acpi.  It is a major userspace ABI break, but removing everything
under /proc/acpi is one of the very few ABI breaks we actually have the
green light to do.

However, the patchset is not about this.

With this patchset applied, as far as I can tell anything that used to be
uevent-driven by the backlight class will break: when a process changes the
backlight using sysfs, other processes will not be notified of the change
anymore.  This patchset seems to break backlight uevent support in such a
way that basically renders the entire thing useless and you might as well
just remove uevent support entirely.

It is also an userspace ABI break, which we do not do lightly.

So, as far as I'm concerned, this patchset should be rejected in its present
form.  IMO, either one that preserves BACKLIGHT_UPDATE_SYSFS and fixes the
urgent issue, or one that removes uevent support entirely from the backlight
class should be proposed instead.
