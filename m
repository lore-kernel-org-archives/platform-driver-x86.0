Thanks for bringing this thread to our attention, Julia.

We indeed do have a tool that is able to calculate the conditions under
which a line of code is activated or not, taking the constraints from
Kconfig into account. This allows us e.g. to find nested/broken ifdefs
like

#ifndef CONFIG_DEBUG_FS
=2E..
#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_FS
#else
#endif
=2E..
#endif

because we are taking kconfig into account, the inner CPP item can also
be some other kconfig item on which CONFIG_DEBUG_FS depends and we woul=
d
still find it.

I'm not sure yet how to turn this technique into a tool that would be
helpful to solve this particular problem. Maybe we can integrate this
somehow in coccinelle?

regards,
        Reinhard.
