I agree. I'll repost this one in some days.

No.
But this should not be important enough to not get this removed.
It's hard to re-implement the exact behaviour (which can be handy for
specific problems, I agree).
With:
watch -n1 ec_access -r
you can have a close look at specific registers and see them changing.
Whatabout:
ec_access -r -s time(s)
Reads the table once and again after "time" seconds with stars
where modifications happened. Then someone can plug AC or hit a button
and look at the diff in EC registers afterwards.
This should be sufficient?
Better ideas?

Thanks,

       Thomas
