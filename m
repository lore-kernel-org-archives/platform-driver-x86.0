I looked at DSDT dumps of four different Fujitsu laptops released in the
past ten years or so for which at least one of these two ACPI devices is
present and found no traces of either of these methods being defined for
them.  I do not think we have a way of ensuring that the above holds
true for every other model out there, but I will point out that
fujitsu-laptop is the only user of acpi_bus_update_power() outside of
drivers/acpi.
