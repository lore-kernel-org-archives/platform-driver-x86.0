Btw, I'm getting a similar thing when I unplug my x121e from AC:

[  613.517178] thinkpad_acpi: unknown possible thermal alarm or keyboard event received
[  613.533949] thinkpad_acpi: temperatures (Celsius): 60 0 60 0 0 0 32 0
[  613.536880] thinkpad_acpi: unhandled HKEY event 0x6040
[  613.539703] thinkpad_acpi: please report the conditions when this event happened to ibm-acpi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

this is when I plug it back:

[  623.308867] thinkpad_acpi: unknown possible thermal alarm or keyboard event received
[  623.322868] thinkpad_acpi: temperatures (Celsius): 60 0 60 0 0 0 32 0
[  623.322926] thinkpad_acpi: unhandled HKEY event 0x6040
[  623.322938] thinkpad_acpi: please report the conditions when this event happened to ibm-acpi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

All with 3.6-rc2 + tip/master.

Thanks.
