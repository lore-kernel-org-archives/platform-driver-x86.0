I found dmsdos implementation of that DS compression at:
http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~pisa/dmsdos

Then took relevant decompression code and it really decompressed that=20
binary MOF WMI buffer. But still decompressed format is binary, but I=20
now see all WMI GUID encoded in UTF-16. Decompressed BMF file has again=20
"FOMB" magic header.

I pushed my decompression utility here:
https://github.com/pali/bmfdec

So next step is to decode that decompressed binary MOF file.

Hm... so that Quantum compression is also modification of LZ77. And=20
probably it is same as DoubleSpace format (or use it).
