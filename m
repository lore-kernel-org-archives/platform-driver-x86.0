If we want to avoid having to install a signal handler then I'm pretty
sure we'd need to fixup all #GPs and "bad access" #PFs that occur on
EENTER or in the enclave, not just PF_SGX faults.  SGX1 hardware takes
a #GP instead of a #PF on EPCM faults, and SGX2 hardware allows enclaves
to allocate/free/adjust EPC pages at runtime, e.g. an enclave runtime
might want to intercept #PFs from within the enclave so that the enclave
can dynamically grow its stack.
