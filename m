Refresh my brain, does hardware reset the MSRs on a transition to S3 or lower?

Actually, we can easily support this in the driver, at least for SGX1
hardware.  SGX2 isn't difficult to handle, but we've intentionally
postponed those patches until SGX1 support is in mainline[1].
Accesses to the EPC after it is lost will cause faults.  Userspace
EPC accesses, e.g. ERESUME, will get a SIGSEGV that the process
should interpret as an "I should restart my enclave" event.  The
SDK already does this.  In the driver, we just need to be aware of
this potential behavior and not freak out.  Specifically, SGX_INVD
needs to not WARN on faults that may have been due to a the EPC
being nuked.  I think we can even remove the sgx_encl_pm_notifier()
code altogether.

[1] SGX1 hardware signals a #GP on an access to an invalid EPC page.
    SGX2 signals a #PF with the PF_SGX error code bit set.  This is
    problematic because the kernel looks at the PTEs for CR2 and sees
    nothing wrong, so it thinks it should just restart the
    instruction, leading to an infinite fault loop.  Resolving this
    is fairly straightforward, but a complete fix requires propagating
    PF_SGX down to the ENCLS fixup handler, which means plumbing the
    error code through the fixup handlers or smushing PF_SGX into
    trapnr.  Since there is a parallel effort to plumb the error code
    through the handlers, https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/8/6/924, we opted
    to do this in a separate series.
