This maybe is disputed. 

The problem is that now Fn+F5 only turns on/off wifi and leave bluetooth alone.
According to the design this hotkey shall change the status of all radio
devices, including wifi, bluetooth and wwan.

On machine with wifi and bluetooth, it will turn on/off wifi and bluetooth in
order. On machine with wifi, it will switch wifi mode on every event.

I think it is better to solve this in driver not in user space application 
because on some other platforms, the KEY_WLAN and KEY_BLUETOOTH are separate.

I do not have a clear idea how to deal with wwan interface such as it shall be
exclusive or inclusive with wifi.

Please reply for any opinion.
