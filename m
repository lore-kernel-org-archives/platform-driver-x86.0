Not that I'm aware of. A number machines have this problem, that the
standard ACPI backlight interfaces are implemented but don't work. This
generally isn't detectable in software; with the Apples at least
everything looks like it's working except that the brightness doesn't
change (but not all Apple laptops are affected, so qurking based on
manufacturer wouldn't work). All we're left with is DMI quirking, which
isn't practical. Maybe we could add something so a platform driver can
tell acpi_video that it knows the ACPI backlight doesn't work, but I
think on some platforms that still is going to be based off of DMI
information.

What about userspace? I don't know about other desktops, but in the past
gnome-settings-daemon had a list to determine which backlight to prefer,
so it would have been possible to insert gmux_backlight in the list
above acpi_video0. It seems to have been changed now to use the
backlight type, preferring a firmware backlight to a platform one, which
would prefer acpi_video0 to gmux_backlight. I don't know know what the
solution is under this paradigm.
