Yes.

The EC *is* the i8042 in a ThinkPad.  Really.  You talk to the same chip and
to the same firmware over the ACPI EC ports, the i8042 ports, and the
Renesas extra LPC3 channel (used by HDAPS and SBS).

That said, on a **IBM** ThinkPad, _nothing_ related to the digital volume
control comes from the i8042 port.  In fact, with older BIOSes, you couldn't
even get it from ACPI unless you hooked the GPE directly because the
required ACPI L/E methods were missing and were added by later versions of
the T4x/R4x/X3x BIOS.

The EC firmware in a thinkpad is often more capable than what the BIOS
exposes.

KEY_MUTE comes from the i8042 in Lenovo Thinkpads, only.  And they started
doing that when they removed the hardware volume control chip.  It was
retrofitted in later versions of the T60 BIOS (v2.x), I don't know how well
though.

I am fine that we go with "none" and emulate everything in the driver where
supported, yes.

You didn't try it on a IBM thinkpad, just on Lenovo thinkpads, then...

Since you did due diligency, I'm fine with that.  It is already in a
separate patch, so it is easy to bissect and revert anyway.

I will only be able to do that during the weekend anyway, so feel free to
send a v3 if you need :-)
