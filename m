Thanks for the detailed report.

Note that the results might be different for some laptops with 3.19. See
8f8d75ebf0 ("dell-wmi: Don't report keypresses for radio state changes")
for more details. Basically "238 (rfkill wlan)" should never be reported
with 3.19. Looking at the results of your tests I can see that key 238
is never necessary, confirming that not reporting it is the right thing
to do.
