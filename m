I tested this patch on a Vostro V131 and it seems to work as expected:
"lis3lv02d: 8 bits sensor found" is logged during boot, an input device
gets registered and its axis values seem to be consistent with laptop's
movements.

Tested-by: Michał Kępień <kernel@kempniu.pl>

I did not review the contents of the patch this time, sorry.
