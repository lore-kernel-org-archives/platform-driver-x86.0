Yes. I'm not sure exactly what sequence of memory accesses is causing
the MCEs because the above bug report states that the MCEs were frequent
but intermittent and I don't have any hardware to reproduce this on.

I think it's an x86 bug. AFAIK it's entirely possible to ioremap
arbitrary memory addresses whether or not the firmware/BIOS knows about
them (by which I mean, includes a mapping in the e820 map). It's just
that traditionally the firmware didn't throw MCEs when you peeked at
some part of the address map. The < 1MB region of the x86 address map
also fills me with visions of voodoo.

Jacob Shin and Yinghai Lu have been working on some patches that avoid
mapping the holes (the address regions for which there is no entry in
the e820 memmap) and I think that could be used to address this problem.

> Shouldn't fixing that be the real fix?

Absolutely, and it was always my intention to fix this properly so that
I didn't have the same bug reported to me over and over again. However,
initially I was more concerned about writing a fix that was good enough
and small enough to be marked for stable. Messing with the kernel memory
map, particularly for EFI systems, has been fraught with peril in the
past.
