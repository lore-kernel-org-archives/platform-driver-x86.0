Are you sure?  I'm reasonably confident that the KEY_MUTE comes from
i8042, not from an ACPI GPE.  Even without this patch, pressing the
mute button sends KEY_MUTE.  Maybe there's a control I missed, but if
we turn off KEY_MUTE, then I don't know how we'd be notified at all
that the HW mixer changed state.  (In any case, with this patch,
everything seems to work.)

"none" seems to work well on all ThinkPads that I've tried.  The other
modes seem to have spotty support.

How?  The only way I ever found to do that was using the i8042_filter
in the older incarnations of this driver, and that was incredibly
complex, added little obvious value, and *still* didn't give a fully
consistent UI, since userspace doesn't understand the extra thinkpad
mixer.

I think we only need that for the four models in question.  Also, all
the commit messages for those quirk additions seem to suggest that
they were done to improve volume controls.  And I'm pretty sure I
already checked at least one of those models (that's how I discovered
HAUM/SAUM in the first place).

Anyway, patch 2 is optional.

Please test v2 instead. :)
