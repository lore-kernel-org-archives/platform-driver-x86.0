Who's we?  I sometimes do that, for one.  I guess Takashi does that too.
The tip people do that on a regular basis and I know of at least several
other top-level maintainers doing it at least occasionally.

I beg to differ, but whatever.

In any case, I wouldn't mind it if you took the [3/3] from this series, because
if there are any conflicts with it, they will be trivial to resolve.  And I
don't need an immutable branch with it or anything like that.
