David, please note that non of my changes are merged in 3.2 or 3.3,
they are still in the platform-x86 tree.
But you are right, if they are merged in 3.4 (and I really hope so)
then we will need this patch or there will be a regression.
Anyway, this patch can, and should, be merged as soon as possible
because DE or even xrandr may want to use the non functionnal acpi
backlight instead of others.

Thanks,
