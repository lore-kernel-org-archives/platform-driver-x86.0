I don't have a strong opinion, so do what you want (or what Matthew
will tell you to), but keeping it would allow easier access to
subdevices (/sys/platform/devices is a better place than
/sys/bus/acpi/devices/ for this kind of device in my opinion).

Well, I must admit that I didn't check that, and it's possible that
all you need to do is to deprecate all /proc file if none of them are
actually usefull.
