The idea looks reasonable. In addition to that, I'd change one
thing in the LED naming pattern - replace "devicename " with
"affiliation". AFAICS that would fit best for both "platform"
and e.g. "input*".

Also in the DT we would need related "affiliation" property.
In most cases it would be "platform" probably.
Possible is also "camera" - but we would have to state it clear
how to proceed in case of video devices - shouldn't v4l2
drivers create LEDs similarly to how network drivers do that.
Then it would be possible to provide videoN name.

> What about following? Any other LEDs worth mentioning?
disk: sdX
network devices: ethN, adslN

These "affiliations" would have to be provided by the
network drivers creating LED class devices.

Isn't example missing here?

Two problems here:
- "status-led" is in place of "devicename" instead of "function"
- "-led" is obvious and non-generic - we will have "status"
   in the "functions.h"
