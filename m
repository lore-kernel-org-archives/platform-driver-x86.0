I'm not so sure. The MacBook Pro 8,1 and 8,2 seem to use the same BIOS
implementation -- the version numbers and DSDTs are identical.  The 8,1
has only Intel graphics, no gmux, and a working acpi_video0 backlight
under Linux. The 8,2 has hybrid ATI/Intel, a gmux w/ working backlight
control, and acpi_video0 does not work.

So while I'm not sure, I can't rule out that the acpi_video backlight
might be provided specifically for the 8,1 and that OS X is using it.
Unfortunately I don't have an 8,1 that I can play with to try and work
it out.
