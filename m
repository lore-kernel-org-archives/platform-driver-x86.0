Hi,
I currently trying to fix a bug on the Eeepc 1000H with eeepc-wmi.

I got an acpi notify handler. The notify is triggered when I call WMBC().
In this notify handler, I must re-call WMBC (with some other arguments, it won't
notify again this time).

If I do that, I'll get:
[  176.920391] ACPI Error (dswload-0802): [_T_0] Namespace lookup
failure, AE_ALREADY_EXISTS
[  176.920416] ACPI Exception: AE_ALREADY_EXISTS, During name
lookup/catalog (20100428/psloop-231)
[  176.920439] ACPI Error (psparse-0537): Method parse/execution
failed [\AMW0.WMBC] (Node f7023b88), AE_ALREADY_EXISTS
[  176.920469] ACPI: Marking method WMBC as Serialized because of
AE_ALREADY_EXISTS error

Then it'll work.

What's the best way to avoid that ?
- Is there some way to tell acpica that this method should be serialized ?
- Is there some way to finish the execution of the first WMBC call in
the notify handler ?
- Should I use a work queue, and do what I have to do later (when the
previous call is finished) ?
- anything else ?

Thanks,
