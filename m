On ideapad Y530, the brightness key notify will be blocked if the last notify
is not responsed by getting the brightness value. Read value when we get the
notify shall fix the problem and will not have any difference on other ideapads.

This patch is made against 2.6.37.y and this bug impacts kernel after 2.6.37.

The equivalent-fix patch is not in upstream yet. Since the policy of stable tree
is changed and .38 kernel is going to finalize. I think to post this patch for
stable kernel now should be a good idea.
