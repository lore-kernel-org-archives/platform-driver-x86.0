I mean please set anything that you don't have a keycode for in the new
keymaps to either KEY_RESERVED (will issue an HKEY ACPI event) or
KEY_UNKNOWN (will issue an input EV_KEY event for KEY_UNKNOWN grouped
with an EV_MSC EV MSC_SCAN event that allows userspace to know which key
was pressed/released even if it has no specific keycode).

I mean if anyone wants to change something that is KEY_RESERVED or
KEY_UNKNOWN they can configure the driver to do so at runtime through
the input device interface, i.e. get udev to do it.

Nothing new, there.

Probably not, but it would be a good idea to double-check.
