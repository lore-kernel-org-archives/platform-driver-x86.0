That commit is in my tree, but the message does not appear. Booted with 
the IOMMU enabled, 24 CPUs, no IOMMU parameters, the only thing matching 
is the unrelated generic ACPI one:

   dmesg | grep -iE 'FW_BUG|Firmware Bug|matched UID|MSFT0201|acpihid'
   AMD-Vi: ivrs, add hid:MSFT0201, uid:1, rdevid:0x60
   ACPI: [Firmware Bug]: BIOS _OSI(Linux) query ignored
   platform MSFT0201:00: Adding to iommu group 0

No "No ACPI device matched UID, but N device(s) matched HID." The UIDs 
agree on this machine:

   IVRS:  hid:MSFT0201, uid:1, rdevid:0x60
   ACPI:  MSFT0201:00, _UID = 1, path \_SB_.MHSP

so get_acpihid_device_id() matches on the first pass and fw_bug is never 
set. Same device path as in your commit, but this BIOS appears to have 
consistent UIDs.

The full AMD-Vi block for this boot:

   ACPI: IVRS 0x000000006B1BF000 0001F6 (v02 LENOVO TP-R2X   00001200 
PTEC 00000002)
   AMD-Vi: ivrs, add hid:AMDI0020, uid:ID00, rdevid:0xa0
   AMD-Vi: ivrs, add hid:AMDI0020, uid:ID01, rdevid:0xa0
   AMD-Vi: ivrs, add hid:AMDI0020, uid:ID02, rdevid:0xa0
   AMD-Vi: ivrs, add hid:AMDI0020, uid:ID03, rdevid:0x98
   AMD-Vi: ivrs, add hid:MSFT0201, uid:1, rdevid:0x60
   AMD-Vi: ivrs, add hid:AMDI0020, uid:ID04, rdevid:0x98
   AMD-Vi: Using global IVHD EFR:0x246577efa2254afa, EFR2:0x10

IA GA PC GA_vAPIC
   AMD-Vi: Interrupt remapping enabled
   AMD-Vi: Virtual APIC enabled

One thing that may be worth your attention anyway: MSFT0201:00 is the 
only ACPI HID device in any IOMMU group on this system, alone in group 
0. It is not the TPM - tpm0 is MSFT0101:00. So the single non-PCI device 
the IOMMU manages here is Pluton.

For what it is worth, when I tested with PlutonSecurityProcessor set to 
Disable earlier in this thread the machine still failed to wake, though 
I did not check at the time whether MSFT0201 was still present in the 
IVRS in that configuration. I can re-run that combination and capture 
the IVRS block if it would help.

 > I think you're missing commit e9f850ba66cd.

You are right. My 6.18.51 tree still has the old code:

   drivers/rtc/rtc-cmos.c:1502:  irq = platform_get_irq(pdev, 0);

which is exactly the path that produces the "-ENXIO: IRQ index 0 not 
found" message I quoted. I will cherry-pick it and report back whether 
the wakealarm shows up. If it does, all further cycles can be timed 
rather than woken by hand, which will make the failing case much easier 
to instrument.

 > I don't know for sure if Think LMI will export all BIOS options in 
the BIOS GUI.

OK. I will go through BIOS setup by hand and look for anything 
controlling storage link power or D3, rather than relying on the 
think-lmi attribute list.

The 7.3-rc4 test is still queued and I will report the same data from it.
