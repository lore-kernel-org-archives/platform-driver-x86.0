The primary consumer of the lpss pwm is the i915 kms driver,
the i915 driver does not support get_pwm returning -EPROBE_DEFER and
its init is very complex making this is almost impossible to fix.

This commit changes the PWM_LPSS Kconfig from a tristate to a bool, so
that when the i915 driver loads the lpss pwm will be available avoiding
the -EPROBE_DEFER issue. Note that this is identical to how the same
problem was solved for the pwm-crc driver, which is used by the i915
driver on other platforms.
