We've already received negative feedback regarding blocking
application of different trigger when hw brightness change notifications
are enabled. One solution to that is making the notifications
orthogonal to the trigger mechanism. The other possibility is to allow
for having more than one active trigger for a LED.

We could think of defining a special type of persistent trigger that
would be always enabled.
