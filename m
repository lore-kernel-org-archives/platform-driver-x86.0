The name pmc_plt_clk_<n> follows the data sheet specification, where 
this convention is suggested:
   PLT_CLK[2:0] - Camera
   PLT_CLK[3] - Audio Codec
   PLT_CLK[4] -
   PLT_CLK[5] - COMMs

These clocks are not internal but are made available to external 
components through dedicated physical pins on the package, this external 
visibility limits the scope for confusions, variations. I have not seen 
any skews where these clocks and pins were changed at all.
