+Description:	This file allows iio devices selection.
+
+		Attribute select_iio can be written with 0 or with 1. It
+		selects which one of iio devices can be accessed.
+
+		The file is read/write.

+Description:	These files allow asserting system power cycling, switching
+		power supply units on and off and system's main power domain
+		shutdown.
+		Expected behavior:
+		When pwr_cycle is written 1: auxiliary power domain will go
+		down and after short period (about 1 second) up.
+		When  psu1_on or psu2_on is written 1, related unit will be
+		disconnected from the power source, when written 0 - connected.
+		If both are written 1 - power supplies main power domain will
+		go down.
+		When pwr_down is written 1, system's main power domain will go
+		down.
+
+		The files are write only.

+Description:	These files show the system reset cause, as following: power
+		auxiliary outage or power refresh, ASIC thermal shutdown,
+		hotswap or watchdog, firmware reset, long press power button,
+		short press power button, software reset. Value 1 in file means
+		this is reset cause, 0 - otherwise. Only one of the above
+		causes could be 1 at the same time, representing only last
+		reset cause.
+
+		The files are read only.
