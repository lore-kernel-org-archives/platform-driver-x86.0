#facepalm

This is all too common unfortunately. Firmware really needs to describe the
platform independently from the OS. Dell has presented some compelling arguments
for why this isn't always feasible, but all too often there is no good reason
for it. Unfortunately, nothing we can do about it for shipping devices other
than work around the mess.

For the Intel folks on Cc, I'd suggest raising this with Mark as well to get his
help in stamping out as much of this as we can going forward.

Based on the above, I understand the situation a bit better now. You can't know
without the documentation. This serves as a canary, if it changes, then one of
our assumptions is likely wrong and all bets are off.

Right, OK. Too many possibilities to try and account for. Support the known set
and adjust if new owns appear in the wild, or if we get a specification from
Intel.

I'll look for a v2 based on the two minor points above.
