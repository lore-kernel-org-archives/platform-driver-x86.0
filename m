I'd prefer if the above text gets replaced by something that adds a pointer
to the new facility, instead of being just outright removed.  Also, the text
about how to use the facility to detect tachometers and thermometers should
be retained, if at all possible.

Soes your helper userspace util do the "differential" analysis that
thinkpad-acpi used to (the "*" after values that changed since last read)?
