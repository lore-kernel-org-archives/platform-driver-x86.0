In my tree, I reworded this as:

    dell-smbios: don't return an SMBIOS buffer from dell_smbios_send_re=
quest()

    An SMBIOS buffer pointer does not need to be returned by
    dell_smbios_send_request(), because SMBIOS call results are stored =
in
    the buffer exported by the module.

Is that acceptable?
