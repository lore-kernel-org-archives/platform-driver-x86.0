Sorry, that was unintentional I probably accidentally hit reply instead
of reply-to-all.

I've re-added the lists to the Cc.

Ok.

Ok, I need to think a bit about this. I think I've enough info to
come up with a new patch-set not introducing the fcs,vbus-regulator-name
device-property ugliness. But this is a side project and I'm rather busy with $dayjob
atm, so it may take a while for me to come up with a new patch.

Hans
