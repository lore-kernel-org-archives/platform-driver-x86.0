DMAble in what sense? For devices that can't handle physical addresses
above 16M you need to pass __GFP_DMA to get those, from ZONE_DMA.
Otherwise it can return anything from lowmem. That's for x86_64, some
other arches have different DMA zone.

vmalloc() could only be used as an alternative if you used kvmalloc(),
otherwise kmalloc() won't give you anything from vmalloc

Yeah that would be nice.
