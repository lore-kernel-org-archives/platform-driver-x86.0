If we want to make BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE into a library thing then I
guess we could do that, but we must then also drag it out of all the other
meta options to make sure it's always available. No need I think to ditch
the entire BACKLIGHT_LCD_SUPPORT meta option. And then everyone could
select it.

The problem is if you mix depends and select Kconfig falls over and starts
to see loops where there are none. So you really can't ever mix them for
the same symbol.

I think if we get the BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE out of the picture with that
ACPI_VIDEO should be fixable with some

	select ACPI_VIDEO if ACPI

or so. Currently that doesn't work because of the backlight class knob and
select being broken.
