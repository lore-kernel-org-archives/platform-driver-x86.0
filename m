The battery module keeps track of the batteries that get added or removed
from the system. When a hook is registered, it will always get a list
of currently
present batteries not matter of the time when the hook is loaded.

If was not able to produce any race conditions, but I have added some locking
mechanisms in the new, 7th revision of the patch.

This has been solved in version 7 with mutual exclusions.

I have implemented mutual exclusions.

The module that requests the hooks will fail to load with the following
