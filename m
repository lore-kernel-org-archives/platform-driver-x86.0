Tested, and it does not help.

   PlutonSecurityProcessor  Disable -> Enable
   TpmSelection             DiscreteTPM2.0 -> PlutonTPM2.0
   SecurityChip             Enable -> Active

With those set, IOMMU enabled, no IOMMU boot parameters and all 24 CPUs 
online, the machine still does not wake.

Worth noting what that test also covers: with Pluton selected the TPM 
presents through the CRB interface (MSFT0101:00, status=15), and this 
kernel has CONFIG_TCG_CRB=n. So during that suspend Linux had no TPM 
driver bound at all -- no /sys/class/tpm, no /dev/tpm0, and the discrete 
STM0925 was gone from the platform bus. Previously tpm_tis was bound to 
STM0925:00. So this rules out the tpm_tis driver as a factor as well as 
the Pluton policy.

Current state of what is ruled out, all with the IOMMU enabled and 24 
CPUs online:

   amd_pmf                  initcall_blacklist=amd_pmf_driver_init 
no wake
   amdxdna (NPU)            initcall_blacklist=amdxdna_pci_driver_init 
no wake
   TPM driver               no driver bound at all (Pluton/CRB, no 
CONFIG_TCG_CRB)  no wake
   Pluton policy            Pluton enabled, PlutonTPM2.0 
no wake
   interrupt remapping      intremap=off (verified: 0 IR- lines) 
no wake
   DMA remapping            iommu=pt (verified: Passthrough, identity) 
no wake
   vAPIC / GA mode          amd_iommu_intr=legacy (verified) 
no wake

The only two things that let it wake are amd_iommu=off with all 24 CPUs, 
or the IOMMU enabled with nr_cpus=16. Offlining cpu16-23 by hotplug 
after booting with all 24 does not work; they have to never be brought up.

I am rebuilding now with CONFIG_DEBUG_FS, CONFIG_PM_DEBUG, 
CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG and CONFIG_AMD_MP2_STB so I can run amd-s2idle and 
send you the report from the working nr_cpus=16 configuration.
