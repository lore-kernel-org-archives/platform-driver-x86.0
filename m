Ok, thanks for clarification. We will document it.

Agreed.

No, it doesn't. It is just my backup for the non-SDK user space code
that I've made that I will use to fork my user space SGX projects in
the future.

I can work-out a selftest (and provide a new patch in the series) but
I'm still wondering what the enclave should do. I would suggest that
we start with an enclave that does just EEXIT and nothing else.
