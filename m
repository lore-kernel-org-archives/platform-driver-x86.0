Hi,

I'm getting a lot of bug reports about hanging boot/shutdowns on these days.

Most of the affected hardware are ASUS laptops. The problem is that I 
don't have access to any of those problematic laptops and the users are 
not able at all to debug/bisect what is going on. However, I have 
collected dmesgs of good/bad boots, acpidump, etc.

Here are the current status:

"Asus F50SV does not boot unless lapic is passed"
   https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26502

"Regression between 2.6.35-020635-rc1 and 2.6.35-020635 breaks acpi 
support on Asus X71 laptop"
   https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-meta/+bug/689796

"Asus N61JQ hangs at shutdown unless lapic is passed"
(Not reported upstream yet, I've only downstream bug report which is 
Turkish)
   http://bugs.pardus.org.tr/show_bug.cgi?id=15969

"Asus X61S does not boot unless acpi=off is given"
(Not reported upstream yet, I've only downstream bug report which is 
Turkish)
   http://bugs.pardus.org.tr/show_bug.cgi?id=16322
(I've told the reporter to try with nolapic, it will probably fix the 
issue but until confirmed acpi=off is the only solution. 2.6.36 was fine)

I'll post more bugs in here as I've found them.

Thanks,
