This is an excellently prepared series, nice work Micha=C5=82.

Most of my concerns were addressed by later patches in the series. I ha=
ve pushed
a version of this 1/7 fixed per lkp (linux/io.h) and 7/16 with a correc=
ted body
as I sent in reply to that patch. This is on my tree as the dell-smbios=
 branch.

My only major concern is module load order dependencies. Inter-module
dependencies are frowned upon with good reason, the kernel load orderin=
g is
non-deterministic and it's possible, for example, for dell-laptop to fa=
il to
find the symbols exported by dell-smbios under certain conditions.

I have worked around this in the past with things like the following:

#ifdef MODULE
#ifdef CONFIG_FOO_MODULE
	if (request_module("foo"))
		return -ENODEV;
#endif
#endif

Something like the above may be necessary for dell-smbios in dell-lapto=
p,
dell-wmi, and dell-leds now that they depend on the dell-smbios exporte=
d
functions.

Cc Greg in case there is a better way to handle this that I'm not aware=
 of.
