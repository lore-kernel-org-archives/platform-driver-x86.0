I don't see the breakage. For existing blinking and default-on
triggers, existing behaviour would be kept. Difference would be that
for hardware that changes triggers itself (like the keyboard light) we
would present it as a trigger. And you are right -- there would be
user visible changes there. You could not assign blinking, because
=2E. it already has a trigger. But I believe it is reasonable.

I'm not 100% sure in the thinkpad case. In the N900 case, we have LED
that displays (user_brightness || (user_enabled_indicator && cpu_activity)).

I believe clean way to do that would be a trigger.

Well, end user is not expected to touch /sys files directly -- we
should create a script for that. /sys should be logical and map well
to what we do in kernel. Being "nice to use from shell" is
secondary...
