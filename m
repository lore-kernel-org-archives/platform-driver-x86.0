/proc/acpi/ibm has been deprecated for years.  99% of the functionality
is available through more modern, standard interfaces.

thinkpad-acpi is supposed to export standard hwmon temperature sensors
as well.  Try them instead, please.

Also, thinkpad-acpi will report the EC thermal sensors.  They don't need
to (and most often won't) match whatever you read from the processor
core(s).
