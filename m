Hi Bjorn,

sorry for not responding earlier and thanks for picking this thread up 
again.

The first hardware with a resizeable BAR I could find is a Tonga, and 
that is even a generation later than Bonaire.

So we are never going to call this code on earlier hardware generations.

But I think I will just move the asic_type check into the function to be 
absolute sure.

I completely agree on this and it is actually the approach I tried first.

There are just two problems with this approach:
1. When the amdgpu driver is loaded there can already be the VGA 
console, Vesa or EFI driver active for the device and displaying the 
splash screen.

When we resize and most likely relocate the BAR while those drivers are 
active it will certainly cause problems.

What amdgpu does before trying to resize the BAR is kicking out other 
driver and making sure it has exclusive access to the hardware.

2. Without taking a look at the registers you don't know how much memory 
there actually is on the board.

We could always resize it to the maximum supported, but that would mean 
we could easily waste 128GB of address space while the hardware only has 
8GB of VRAM.

That would not necessarily hurt us when we have enough address space, 
but at least kind of sucks.

I already tried the approach with releasing all resources, but it didn't 
worked so well.

When resizing fails because we don't have enough address space then we 
at least want to get back to a working config.

Releasing everything makes that rather tricky, since I would then need 
to keep a backup of the old config and try to restore it.

Additional to that I'm not sure if releasing the register BAR and 
relocating it works with amdgpu.

Christian.
