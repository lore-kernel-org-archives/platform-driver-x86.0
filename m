Not for any wmi driver, only for those which would like to export wmi
device to userspace.

Of course, but in above hypothetical example, user is in situation where
is unable to use both 3rd vendor application and together kernel
rfkill/led/input driver. User must decide (by e.g. modprobe blacklist or
manual module loading) what want to use.

But ideal solution is that both 3rd vendor application for firmware
settings and also rfkill kernel driver would work together without need
to rmmod/modprobe modules and without restarting 3rd vendor application.

Ok. So it is acceptable solution/API/ABI for you & other Dell people?
Or is something more or different needed?

Darren, I hope that I understood your proposal with explicit whitelist
correctly. And is there already another vendor which want to use wmi
userspace on linux?
