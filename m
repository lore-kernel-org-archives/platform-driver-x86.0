Before this modification, the driver reports the brightness keypresses
to userspace and then userspace can respond by changing the brightness
level, as you describe.

You are right in that the hardware doesn't change the brightness
directly itself, which is the normal usage of LED_BRIGHT_HW_CHANGED.

However this approach was suggested by Benjamin Berg and Bastien
Nocera in the thread: Re: [PATCH v2] platform/x86: asus-wmi: Add
keyboard backlight toggle support
https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=152639169210655&w=2

The issue is that we need to support a new "keyboard backlight
brightness cycle" key (in the patch that follows this one) which
doesn't fit into any definitions of keys recognised by the kernel and
likewise there's no userspace code to handle it.

If preferred we could leave the standard brightness keys behaving as
they are (input events) and make the new special key type directly
handled by the kernel?
