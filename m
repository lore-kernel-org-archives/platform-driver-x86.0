Ok, I suspect I know what's going on here - the firmware is probably 
not cancelling the wakeup timer on resume, and on the second suspend 
makes the assumption that the OS has set the wakeup timer and so decides 
that the user wants the machine to wake up. We could add workaround code 
to the irst driver to handle that case, but that would involve it being 
rather more friendly with the system clock than we want. I think the 
right fix is probably to have the rtc driver reset the alarm on resume.
