[Hi, Dmitry -- there's an input layer question in here for you]

I don't think I need help from ALSA.  I just need to stop telling ALSA
that the volume changes twice every time that mute is pressed.  I'll
send v3 out in the next day or two with the fix.

I do, however, have a question for the input people.  Dmitry: Lenovo
makes laptops which are kind enough to tell us that the volume changed
by sending a keystroke over the atkbd-based keyboard.  (wtf!)  I've
modified the thinkpad-acpi driver to register an input handler to
catch those events coming from the keyboard and send them to ALSA
where they belong.  But if there's a keyboard grab, it won't work.
Would you accept a patch to the input layer to allow filters (or maybe
just filters that specifically request it) to run even if there's a
grab?

Without a change to the input layer, if someone grabs the keyboard
then the volume controls will start getting screwed up.  If X grabs
the keyboard it's even worse because pulseaudio will start getting
extra confused and preventing that is the whole point of this patch.

(Yes, it's gross, but the way around it I can see would be to inject a
custom ACPI method, and that still might not be enough to prevent
userspace from seeing a keystroke that it's really not supposed to
see.  And IMHO custom ACPI methods are even worse than input filters.)
