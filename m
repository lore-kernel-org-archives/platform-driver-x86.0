Thanks. So that only leaves Jani's remark:

I personally believe that having the option named disable_backlight_sysfs_if
is better here since I believe that things which are always enabled except
on a few broken model laptops the option name should be disable_foo so
that people can clearly see in /proc/cmdline / dmesg that the user is passing
an option to disable something which is normally enabled.

As for the (!disabled) argument, the code in question here actually is:

if (disabled)
	return 0;

:)

Still if people want me to change the option to a default-on
enable_backlight_sysfs_if option I can do a v3...

Regards,

Hans
