I much prefer it, thank you.

Noted, thanks.

OK, before I dive into a review on this, I'm going to be looking for an=
 ack from
Pali and some Tested-by from the usual suspects. We're already into the=
 merge
window and this series needs to spend some time in next. We'll plan on =
getting
this into next after the merge window closes and have it land in 4.6. H=
opefully
that will allow us to work through Andy's wmi rearchitecting at the sam=
e time
and catch any incompatibilities without introducing undue churn to main=
line.

My favorite kind of patch              ^ :-)

Thanks!
