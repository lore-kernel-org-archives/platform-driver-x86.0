I'm fine with extending battery devices, in fact I agree that it would be a
better place to add these attributes to.

Thinkpad batteries are static, BAT1 is always BAT1 for the firmware,
regardless of whether BAT0 is present or not.  Their parameters can always
be set as well, since they're stored in the EC and not in the battery pack
uC.  And the EC doesn't care whether the battery is present or not.

We could change the ACPI battery driver to optionally allow a platform
driver (or a dmi table) to order it to register batteries that are not
present at boot, and set that flag for thinkpads.

All SBS batteries support it, which means most notebooks do.  Whether they
expose it or not, and whether their platform drivers know about it or not in
order to expose these parameters to the kernel and to userspace, is a
separate issue.

Refer to: http://www.sbs-forum.org/

So yes, we can and should add these as generic *optional* parameters for
generic batteries.  How to best add it to the ACPI battery driver is
something to think about.
