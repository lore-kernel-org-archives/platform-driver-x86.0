This is why we can't rely on a method ID granular filter for which methods are
exported to userspace. In my previous reply to Rafael, I suggested platform
drivers decide which method IDs are exported, and for platforms with
insufficient WMI method ID granularity, we will end up exposing methods we also
use in the kernel. The WMI evaluation will need to be centralized and placed
under mutual exclusion. The optional wmi evaluation filter would allow for
drivers to audit incoming calls from userspace to ensure no conflict.

It's not ideal - but I believe it addresses our reality.

We could drop all the in kernel wmi drivers and rely on userspace daemons per
platform.... but I think we all agree that is not where we want this to go. So
we'll need to find a compromise. Even then, we'd need to avoid competition for
common method IDs across multiple userspace applications.

This was my initial response as well. The biggest problem with it is it places
Linux imposed restrictions on the WMI mechanism, which will ultimately stifle
innovation and/or leave Linux as a second class citizen for systems which rely
on WMI for userspace firmware management.

I'd like to also point out that the Linux kernel has a minimal and targeted set
of WMI drivers generally aimed at making laptops work as expected through the
only mechanism we had access to. To my knowledge, we never sat down to discuss
how WMI should be implemented in the Linux ecosystem. That leaves us in the
situation we are in today, in which Linux essentially took the most expedient
route to making laptops work - which happened to be WMI, but we didn't consider
the broader implications of that mechanism or how what we implemented would
interact with full set of functionality provided by WMI.

So our challenge now is to look at WMI as a whole. How should it be implemented
to achieve feature parity. And then consider how the existing drivers fit into
that. Please see my proposal in response to Rafael's latest reply. I believe it
outlines a reasonable compromise.
