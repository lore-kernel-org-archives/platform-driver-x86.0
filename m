Without knowing what buttons you have I'll just throw out some
suggestions. Wifi, sleep/hibernate, battery status, brightness up/down,
and various zoom buttons are some of the ones that I see on the NB505.

On Debian/Ubuntu it's in the input-utils package, I don't know about
other distros. Source is at http://www.kraxel.org/cgit/input/.

Basic instructions are to use lsinput to identify the device you want to
test, then pass the event device number as the argument to input-utils,
which will dump the raw events that come out for only that device. Your
hotkeys should come out of either the device named "Toshiba input
device" or "AT Translated Set 2 Keyboard", or some on both.

Have you tried it with the -s argument to see if a scancode is produced?
Both the Toshiba and AT keyboard input devices should leave a message in
dmesg though if they see an unknown scancode though.
