Consider the following scenario.

There are two independent devices coupled together by functional dependencies:
 - USB OTG (dwc3-pci)
 - extcon (tested with extcon-intel-mrfld, not yet in upstream)

Each of the driver services a corresponding device is built as a module. In the
Buildroot environment the modules are probed by alphabetical ordering of their
modaliases. The latter comes to the case when USB OTG driver will be probed
first followed by extcon one.

So, if the platform anticipates extcon device to be appeared, in the above case
we will get deferred probe of USB OTG, because of ordering.

Now, a cherry on top of the cake, the deferred probing list contains
the only two modules, i.e. USB OTG and extcon. Due to above circumstances,
values in the local_trigger_count and deferred_trigger_count are not the same,
and thus provokes deferred probe triggering again and again.

...

Deeper investigation shows the culprit commit 58b116bce136
("drivercore: deferral race condition fix") which was dedicated to fix some
other issue while bringing a regression.

This reverts commit 58b116bce13612e5aa6fcd49ecbd4cf8bb59e835 for good until
we will have better solution.
