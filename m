Hi Rafael,

I've noticed only now that the PCI core has 2 separate functions
for detecting presence of a device, pci_dev_present() which only
searches the list of enumerated devices, and pci_device_is_present(),
which tests actual presence by reading from the device's config space.

Thus it would actually be consistent to have acpi_dev_present()
(only searches namespace) and acpi_device_is_present() (calls _STA).

But I assume you still want it renamed, right? Just to clarify.

Thanks,

Lukas
