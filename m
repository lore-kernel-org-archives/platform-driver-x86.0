Current ideapad_sync_rfk_state() code does not really toggle the
hardware swtich (I mean to write_ec_cmd with 0x24 command). It just
assumes that the BIOS or EC is responsible for the wifi switch-on/-off
and reports the state via rfkill_set_hw_state().

In my case, without explicit sending the 0x24 command to turn off the
radio device, the wifi LED is always on.

Though it might not be true or applicable on ideapads,  in my last
experience on Dell laptops that to switch off the RF radio in the
driver while the hardware claims to control it can cause some mess-up.

So to be safe I prefer not to move the toggle code in ideapad_sync_rfk_=
state().
