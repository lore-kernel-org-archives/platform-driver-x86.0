100 events per second is probably not happening, but on my Latitude I
see that sometimes more events are delayed and delivered at once.

What about just dropping upcoming one event in interval of next 2-3
second? Instead of trying to remember last state in kernel and then
trying to mach if received event was that which was caused by change?

This would allow us to reduce doing one SMM call for each received
event and I think it would be same reliable as your approach.
