Here is how I envision using these keys.  I wanted to map quick press
to GNOME3/KDE4/Unity's Activities menu and map press-and-hold to
script that rotates screen.  I like the repeating of rotates but I
didn't really want a rotate to also force a pop up of the activities
menu.

I've only had limited time to look more.  So far, I found under udev a
toshiba tablet that maps what is probably a rotate button to
KEY_DIRECTION so thats one option for it instead of KEY_PROG2.  I
couldn't find anybody using that though.

I see in /usr/share/X11/symbols/inet:

    key <I162>   {      [ XF86RotateWindows     ]       };

and in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/evdev:

xkb/keycodes/evdev:     <I162> =3D 162;   // #define KEY_CYCLEWINDOWS  =
      154

Looks like KEY_CYCLEWINDOWS is already hooked up to
gnome-settings-daemon to auto-rotate screen?

I ran into total dead end for finding a pre-existing example of home
button usage.  I'm really surprised we do not yet have a KEY_LAUNCHER
or similar because so many tablet PCs/smartphones/pads do have a
button with this specific concept of "bring up your icon based
application launcher".

To add to your list, I'll also throw out:

- KEY_MENU
- KEY_EXIT (smartphones sometime mean this)
- KEY_PROG3 (basically all that Windows is doing)
- KEY_LAUNCHER (why not be the first to finally create it!)

I vote for either KEY_PROG3 or KEY_HOMEPAGE for at least short term.
