Right, in that case maybe we do need the DMI quirk and the DMI quirk
needs to point to a specific struct acpi_gpio_mapping for that model
laptop ?

Either there is some logic and the code can be generic, or there
is no logic and then we need to not pretend that the code is generic.

And in my mind the current code at least pretends to be somewhat
generic.

Thinking more about this, I do not think that the current patch does
what it is supposed to do at all.

According to the commit msg there is 1 GPIO listed in the _DSD
props and the ACPI lookup added is using the same "cs-gpios" conid
as the _DSD dependent code in drivers/spi/spi.c and it is getting
the gpio with:

smi->cs_gpio = devm_gpiod_get(dev, "cs", GPIOD_OUT_HIGH);

which is equivalent to:

smi->cs_gpio = devm_gpiod_get_index(dev, "cs", 0, GPIOD_OUT_HIGH);

which is the same lookup as the already succeeded lookup of CS0
in drivers/spi/spi.c .

for CS1 the lookup should be:

smi->cs_gpio = devm_gpiod_get_index(dev, "cs", 1, GPIOD_OUT_HIGH);

and the struct acpi_gpio_mapping should point to an array of
acpi_gpio_params[[] with 2 entries, with the first entry
duplicating the GPIO from the _DSD info and the second entry
pointing to the actual CS1 chip-select.


Andy, you know the ACPI gpio-lookup code better then me, can
you confirm that since the con_id between _DSD props and
the added acpi_gpio_mapping is the same that calling:

smi->cs_gpio = devm_gpiod_get(dev, "cs", GPIOD_OUT_HIGH);

aka:

smi->cs_gpio = devm_gpiod_get_index(dev, "cs", 0, GPIOD_OUT_HIGH);

will just return the GPIO from the _DSD again ?

Regards,

Hans
