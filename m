I'm curious, do you still see this issue if you first kill
gnome-power-manager first?

Wasn't fixed in my case.  I'd be curious to here if it fixes for you.

With latest firmware, I get zero hotkey events over /dev/input/event*
unless I add acpi_backlight=3Dvendor to boot options.  When I add that
option, I finally get correct events out /dev/input/event* and not any
duplicate.

In all cases, I get some kind of events by monitoring /proc/acpi/event
when pressing Fn-* but not any duplicates... and I suspect those are
not considered  as duplicates of /dev/input/*.
