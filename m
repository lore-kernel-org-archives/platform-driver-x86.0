Hi All,

This patch adds support for another ACPI HID which describes multiple
i2c-clients in a single node. As such this applies on top of the recent
patch from Andy making a similar change for INT3515 nodes:

Commit a3dd034a1707 ("ACPI / scan: Create platform device for INT3515
ACPI nodes"), which is in the platform-drivers-x86-v4.21-1 tag.

As such I believe it would be best to merge this tree through the
linux-platform-drivers-x86 tree, as was done for the INT3515 patch.

Rafael, may we have your ack for merging the single line drivers/acpi
change through the linux-platform-drivers-x86 tree?

Regards,

Hans
