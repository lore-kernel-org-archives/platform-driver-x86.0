Ah yes, of course. Perhaps obvious in hindsight, but a bit more explanation in
the commit message would have eliminated the confusion.

Always provide enough information in your commit log to explain to someone else
that hasn't been looking at the code as recently as you have to understand the
problem, the solution, and which provides sufficient explanation for all changes
included in the patch.

Please resubmit with a more complete commit message.
