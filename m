Bug 86521 uncovered that some TOS6208 devices also return
non zero values on a write call to the backlight method,
thus getting caught and bailed out by the extra check code.

This patch changes the set_lcd_brightness function to its
"original" state by just adapting it to the new function
format.

Changes since v1:
- Simply revert the commit to its original state by just
  adapting the code to the new function format

Darren,

This patch simply reverts the commit so the bug can be closed,
I'll send a few patches later which will include the change
needed to block the backlight on TOS1900 devices for review.
