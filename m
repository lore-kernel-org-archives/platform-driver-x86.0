About every 22 seconds.

It'd be ideal if we can find the real use of the notification and
assign it a corresponding keycode, but now I am not able to find any.

Since it occurs in a period when AC cord unplugged, I suspect it is
just a notification to the Windows App, probably due to that the App
is badly written and the App does not want to poll the battery
information. In Linux the userspace can access the battery information
in an easier way through the ACPI proc/sysfs and it is probably not
true in Windows. It could be the reason/purpose why this notification
is sent in a period.

If so, it should be safe to filter out.
