I've not read it mostly through.

I'm far from convinced when it comes to the locking. I always find it very 
suspicious when a lock is taken just to read/write a variabl, as 
immediately after releasing the lock, the protection is lost so the locks 
look either overkill (just a barrier would suffice for racing with init) 
or unsafe (racing with uninit/remove). My head hurts enough from all the 
readong so I don't want go figure out which one it is.

Code quality varies a lot, there are some fragments that seem almost 
braindead but then some other parts use modern things like cleanup.h 
helpers, so it's a mixed bag. My suggestion is would be for you to do a 
full self-review of the series so you could catch the bits I missed (I 
know it's a lot of lines, but hey, I've read it myself now so I know what 
it means to review it through(!)). I know you generally seem able to 
provide good review feedback for others and write clean looking patches so 
it's probably just some of the code originates from other people and 
you've not just looked enough lines to clean it up properly.
