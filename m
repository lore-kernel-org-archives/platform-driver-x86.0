Yes, see below.

The previous implementation (type 1) accepted values 0-60,
but the new one (type 2) just accepts 1-60, so I basically
just changed both to the new range.

Typo there, sorry.

Opposite (again, welcome to Toshiba's KBD BL implementation).

For type 1, to change modes you set (OR?) the value to
the current mode, if FNZ, you set it to AUTO, and viceversa.
Now, to change the time (in case we are in AUTO), you set
the timeout to the opposite mode, if AUTO, you set it to FNZ,
and viceversa (of course this will never happen as the sysfs
entry is hidden).

For type 2, to change modes and time you set the value to the desired
mode (ON, OFF or AUTO), again, the time can only be changed when
in AUTO mode (entry is hidden).

Perhaps something like this?

/* Type 1 requires FNZ mode, if set to AUTO, the time
 * will change, but the mode will be changed as well
 */

We're not changing modes here, just time. Perhaps that comment
is misleading, I can probaly change it to:

/* Type 2 requires SCI_KBD_MODE_AUTO */

Or leave it blank, or perhaps be more verbose:

/* Type 2 requires SCI_KBD_MODE_AUTO, if set to another
 * mode, the time will change but the mode will change as well
 */

Because the timeout entry only takes place (and appears)
whenever the keyboard mode is set to AUTO, on any other
mode is hidden.

> Is it because by setting the timeout we are always changing to _AUTO?

Yes and no.
If the timeout entry exists, that means we are in AUTO, however,
the timeout can be changed even if we are on another mode (without
changing modes).

Yes, you can do that, and it will change the time successfuly,
but again, this entry only appears whenever in AUTO mode,
so we only have one mode to deal here with.

I was just propagating the error code from toshiba_kbd_illum_status_set,
as it was already done on toshiba_kbd_bl_mode_store, but I can leave
this part intact if that's a concern, even tho' the kbd_mode file was recently
introduced.
