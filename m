Thanks for the response.

I think that a more generic approach is a good idea, but
I don't think creating a new power supply device would be the right
choice because this controls existing supplies rather than being a
supply in itself, and I am not aware of any other kind of power
supply device that allows setting things.

We could extend the existing battery devices and then get paths like
	/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/start_charge_thresh
which looks `natural'. There is one problem with that approach, though:

A ThinkPad supports multiple batteries: In my case, I could add a slice
battery. But the ACPI driver only exposes a BAT0 device without a slice
being attached (I assume a BAT1 will pop-up if you add a slice battery,
but can't test it, as I don't own one). This means that you can only
configure the slice battery when it's plugged in. I don't know if its
a good idea to work like this.

Another problem is that I don't know any other systems supporting charge
thresholds, and I don't want to dictate interfaces built for ThinkPads
as a generic way.
