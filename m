I usually provide a signed-off-by, as I am the thinkpad-acpi driver
maintainer... reviewed-by is implied in that case.

Let's wait a little bit to see if we get a reply on the keycodes.  That
said, Bastien, feel free to send the next version at any time. I won't
object to the initial keymap being full of KEY_RESERVED/KEY_UNKNOWN and
receiving incremental patches later.  It might even help merging, as you
could merge the new keycodes in a smaller patchset through the input
tree, later.

But I really want to see a patch added to the series that updates the
driver documentation before the series gets merged.  It should document
any new sysfs entries, and also the relevant HKEY events related to the
adaptative keyboard, as well as the new keymap.
