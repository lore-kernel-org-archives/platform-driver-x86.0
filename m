Well, I personally think that this code should go into arch/x86/ as library code
needed to access IOSF Sideband on some platforms.  I probably would make modules
depending on it select it, so for example if the RAPL driver is going to be
built, your driver should be build either and rather unconditionally in that
case.

So the rule should be "if something *may* need it, build it" in my opinion.
