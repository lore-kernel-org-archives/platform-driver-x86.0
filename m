Please don't do top posting.

That's why I used modal verb "might" instead of "would".

Giving more thoughts about design and use of this I would propose to
do the following.

1. Create under clock framework something like clk-pmc-atom clock
driver (see, for example, clk-fractional-divider, though this one
should indeed go under x86 folder).
2. In real provider, i.e. pmc_atom, create the necessary clock tree
with *names*.

Scheme with ID is fragile, imagine another version of PMC where
ordering would be mixed up? It's not hypothetical since we used to
have this already in pmc_atom for some registers and bits.
