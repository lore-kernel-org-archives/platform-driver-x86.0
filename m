Actually, that's not exactly the case any more.

After some changes that went in for 4.13-rc1 there is an additional decision
point in the resume path, after the noirq stage, where we can decide to go back
to sleep if that's the right thing to do.

This means that in principle you might hack the CMOS RTC driver to do something
more sophisticated than just calling pm_wakeup_hard_event() in rtc_handler().

That's ACPI-specific, but I think you have ACPI on all of the systems where the
residency counders are going to be checked anyway.

Thanks,
Rafael
