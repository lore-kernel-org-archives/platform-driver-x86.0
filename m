That works for me.

I've never seen _SRS for host bridges either.  I'm curious about what
sort of new table will be proposed.  It seems like the existing ACPI
resource framework could manage it, but I certainly don't know all the
issues.

Logically, this should be done before we enumerate the PCI devices
below the host bridge, so a PCI device fixup is not the ideal place
for it, but it might be the most practical.

I could imagine some sort of quirk like the ones in
drivers/pnp/quirks.c that could add the window to the host bridge _CRS
and program the bridge to open it.  But the PCI host bridges aren't
handled through the path that applies those fixups, and it would be
messy to identify your bridges (you currently use PCI vendor/device
IDs, which are only available after enumerating the device).  So this
doesn't seem like a viable strategy.
