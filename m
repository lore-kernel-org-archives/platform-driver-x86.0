It is the safest way, but the correct pseudo-code would be, assuiming
unsigned:

when someone changes start:

if (start > 99)
	start = 99;
get_current_stop_treshold(&stop);
if (start > stop)
	stop = start + 1;
set_thresholds(start, stop);


when someone changes stop:

if (stop == 0 || stop > 100)
	stop = 100;
get_current_start_threshold(&start);
if (start > stop)
	start = stop - 1;
set_thresholds(start, stop);

And write the stop threshold mod 100 at the low-level "send thresholds to
the firmware" routine.

Yes.  This behaviour exists since start/stop thresholds were first exported
outside the EC, in the X30 or thereabouts.

Then it is best if we enforce it in the driver.  I've crashed thinkpad ECs
before, *don't tempt the gremilins* indeed.
