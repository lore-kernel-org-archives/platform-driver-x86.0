no, i did not mean sysfs api. I mean include internal header files via
#include ../../ 
e.g.in drivers/usb/image/microtek.c

#include "../../scsi/scsi.h"
#include <scsi/scsi_host.h>

i did not call sysfs internal calls, just need to use 
struct sysfs_dirent {}

to do the following sanity check against user passed event control file,
it is still not a 100% strong check. 
	/* check if the cfile belongs to the same rapl domain */
	if (strcmp(rd->kobj.sd->s_name,
			cfile->f_dentry->d_parent->d_name.name)) {
		pr_debug("cfile does not belong to domain %s\n",
			rd->kobj.sd->s_name);
		ret = -EINVAL;
		goto exit_cleanup_fds;
	}

I did run the driver as module since i didn't use sysfs internal
functions, just the struct. I may be hitting a corner case here, but
for drivers who need to discover sysfs hierarchy would it be useful to
expose some info in struct sysfs_dirent{}?
