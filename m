I read this:

"IIRC both dell-smo8800 and lis3lv02d represent one HW device (that ST
microelectronics accelerometer) but due to complicated HW abstraction
and layers on Dell laptops it is handled by two drivers, one ACPI and
one i2c."

and that is the core of the issue. You have 2 drivers fighting over the
same device. Fix this and it will all work.

As far as I can see hp_accel instantiates lis3lv02d and accesses it via
ACPI methods, can the same be done for Dell?

I do not consider throwing a unit down an ordinary user interaction ;)
So there is no input event code for this.

Userspace should really use IIO accelerometer interface here. And kernel
could provide composite IIO->/dev/freefall bridge, like we did for
/dev/input/mice when all userspace wanted only PS/2.

Thanks.
