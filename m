Hi Jan,

Taking a closer look at the driver and the git log, the driver was disabled for
EFI because it pokes at BIOS memory and that would mean poking at a completely
different memory map when in EFI mode - it would be expected to fail - and in
some cases it failed by bricking the laptop. See:

e0094244e41c samsung-laptop: Disable on EFI hardware

What appears to be needed here is for someone with the hardware and some
experience tracing ACPI calls from whatever OS it ships with to figure out the
new interface. I suspect it is either pure ACPI or possibly WMI, and a new
driver may be needed.

Have you tried this driver in BIOS mode with the OA change above?
