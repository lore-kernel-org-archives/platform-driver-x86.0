The problem with that is that it's impossible for a code reader to
verify that.  So adding a check is ugly but I think makes it more
readable.

I don't understand the problem here yet.  If you need to enable the
device, then disable it, resize, and re-enable it, that's fine.

The important thing I'm looking for is that the resize happens before
a pci_enable_device(), because pci_enable_device() is the sync point
where the PCI core enables resources and makes them available to the
driver.  Drivers know that they can't look at the resources before
that point.  There's a little bit of text about this in [1].

Enable, read regs, disable, kick out other drivers, resize, enable.
Does that solve this problem?

If resizing fails because of lack of address space, I would expect the
PCI core to at least restore to the previous state.  If it doesn't, I
think that would be a defect.

Having the driver specify the BARs it thinks might cause issues feels
like a crutch.

If the BAR can't be relocated, that sounds like a hardware defect.  If
that's really the case, you could mark it IORESOURCE_PCI_FIXED so we
don't move it.  Or if it's an amdgpu defect, e.g., if amdgpu doesn't
re-read the resource addresses after pci_enable_device(), you should
fix amdgpu.
