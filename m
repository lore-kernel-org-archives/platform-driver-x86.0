The mux certainly does not belong in the USB phy node, it sits between the USB PHY
and the Type-C connector and can for example also mux the Type-C pins to a Display
Port PHY.

As for putting it in a type-C connector node, currently we do not have such a node,
the closest thing we do have to a node describing it is actually the fusb302 node
itself. E.g. it may also contain a regulator to turn Vbus on / off (already there
in the code, but I forgot to document this when I added the missing DT bindings
doc for the fusb302 with a previous patch).

Also these properties:

>>   - fcs,max-sink-microvolt : Maximum voltage to negotiate when configured as sink
>>   - fcs,max-sink-microamp  : Maximum current to negotiate when configured as sink
>>   - fcs,max-sink-microwatt : Maximum power to negotiate when configured as sink

Have more to do with the charger-IC used (which determines the limits) then with
the fusb302 itself, but the fusb302 needs to know these as it negotiates the limits.

Likewise the fusb302 negotiates how the data pins will be used and thus to which pins
on the SoC the mux should mux the data pins.

TL;DR: The fusb302 does all the negotiation and ties all the Type-C connected
ICs together, so this seems like the right place for it (it certainly is the
natural place to put these from a driver code pov).

Hans
