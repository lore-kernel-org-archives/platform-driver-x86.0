Sorry for I didn't really capture what your mean. Please then me
introduce the issue's background:

=46or the beginning, I added this patch to acer-wmi driver:

http://git.kernel.org/?p=3Dlinux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=3D=
commit;h=3D466449cfe797b8a5d82d25d0e0e08426d8dfba19

Because Acer notebook's BIOS can keep the devices state when system
reboot, so, the above patch add the logic when acer-wmi driver initial
to query the devices state by wmi method then set soft-block to
acer-wmi's killswitch, including wlan, bluetooth and wwan.

The acer-wmi used rfkill_init_sw_state to set the initial state before
rfkill register.

There have source code in rfkill_init_sw_state to set rfkill to
persistent, then rfkill/core.c replicate acer-wmi's bluetooth state to
the same type's rfkill.

        if (!rfkill->persistent || rfkill_epo_lock_active) {
                schedule_work(&rfkill->sync_work);
        } else {
#ifdef CONFIG_RFKILL_INPUT
                bool soft_blocked =3D !!(rfkill->state & RFKILL_BLOCK_S=
W);

                if (!atomic_read(&rfkill_input_disabled))		//when rfkil=
l-input enable
                        __rfkill_switch_all(rfkill->type, soft_blocked)=
;	//set sw block state to the same type
#endif
        }

>=20

No, BIOS only emit acpi notify when user press function key, acer-wmi
driver emit KEY_WLAN to userland after receive the acpi notify. Of
course at this moment, acer-wmi driver need to maintain rfkill state to
sync with real device state.

Yes, acer BIOS's default value is bluetooth disabled. So, when system
boot, there only have acer-wmi's bluetooth killswitch:

0: acer-wireless: Wireless LAN
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
1: acer-bluetooth: Bluetooth
        Soft blocked: yes		# default is sw block
        Hard blocked: no
2: acer-threeg: Wireless WAN
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
4: phy0: Wireless LAN
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no

There have no hci0's killswtich, because BT device power off by BIOS
when system cold boot.

Per Old=C5=99ich's report, he press bluetooth hardware key then see lik=
e the
following:

4: phy0: Wireless LAN
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
6: acer-wireless: Wireless LAN
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
7: acer-bluetooth: Bluetooth
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
8: acer-threeg: Wirele        Hard blocked: no
9: hci0: Bluetooth
        Soft blocked: yes	# create hci0 rfkill but default is soft bloc=
ked
        Hard blocked: no

I didn't have bluetooth HW key on my Acer machine, but I can unblock ac=
er-wmi bluetooth
rfkill manually to reproduce this issue.

If only use bluetooth HW key to control the rfkill, then it should be
fine. But, Old=C5=99ich report still have problem cann't enable bluetoo=
th
after he press HW key because hci0's bluetooth default set to soft
blocked.

If we want to remove rfkill-input, then we need re-compiler kernel. Why
don't add a option for enable/disable it ?

Yes, fully agreed your point.=20
That's why I highly suggest Old=C5=99ich to use urfkill daemon to corre=
ct
this situation by userland.

> Still though I don't understand how we arrive at the issue at all.
>=20

Old=C5=99ich's point is current Kconfig for rfkill-input is set to !EXP=
ERT,
that mean any normal user will mean the above problem: hci0's rfkill
default value is soft block. It didn't enable by acer'w HW bluetooth
key.
And, like you said, there still didn't have any distro include urfkill
daemon.

Thank's a lot!
