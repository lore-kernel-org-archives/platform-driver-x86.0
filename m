I think this was aimed at my proposal to send an input event
KEY_DIRECTION from within asus_laptop driver, which wouldn't provide
context with regard to which accelerometer device triggered it (although
in our setup there's only one device, and the ACPI event doesn't provide
any context either, but at least we know it's an ACPI accelerometer).

An udev event(e.g "change") works for me, it would provide context, and
wouldn't disturb the handling of the polled-input device which we'd like
to open as little as possible.

Anyway, whatever solution we choose, the priority is to get this driver
included, even if we don't support the "Coarse Orientation Changed" event
in kernel yet.
