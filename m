Hi,

this is the revised v5 patch set to add the support for Dollar Cove TI
PMIC found on some Intel Cherry Trail laptops / tablets.  All drivers
are based on the original code from Intel downstream patches, with
lots of rewrites and cleanups.  MFD driver is implemented as a
stand-alone driver like a few other variants, and the input driver got
a diet in a minimalistic form.

The patch set has been tested on ASUS E100H and E200H, as well as on
HP x210.


thanks,

Takashi
