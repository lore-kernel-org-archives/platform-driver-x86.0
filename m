Hello!

What is preferred way from kernel driver to inform userspace=20
about LED device brightness change? In /sys/class/leds/<device>/=20
is file brightness which can be used to read current brightness=20
or set write new value. But sometimes also firmware (or device)=20
can change value on its own and thus userspace software which=20
provides slider for setting brightness will be incorrect.

=46or example on Dell laptops there is driver which support setting=20
and reading keyboard backlight (via leds kernel interface). But=20
firmware/BIOS can change brightness (when something happen) and=20
it can inform running system about this change via ACPI/WMI event=20
interface. But how to use kernel led interface to inform userpace=20
about this change? It is possible?
