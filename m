Why do you presume it works under Windows? Boot camp installs a pile of
drivers for Windows, one of those could be a driver for the backlight. I
don't know either way. But it's pretty clear that MacOS is using the
gmux for the backlight when it is present from the reverse engineering
work done by others.
