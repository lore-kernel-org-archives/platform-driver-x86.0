Yes, we do need something like this.  It turns out the BIOS can
optionally program several of these values, and we need to sanity check
them.  If they're not valid (e.g. a core power limit of 0 or MCP temp
limit of 0xffff) we need to use the default values in the limit structs.

I think the programmed limits are valid if they're nonzero and less
than one of the available default limits.  If they're not valid, we
should just use the default values.  I was thinking something like the
below for MCP, but Joe you may want to just update your patch instead
since it's more complete.

Thanks,
