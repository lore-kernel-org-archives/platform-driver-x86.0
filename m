Hi Johaness,

Just a small correction.

hci0 doesn't exist when the BT switch is off. The hci0 device and rfkil=
l switch=20
appears when you unblock SW rfkill or by pressing the HW switch. It dis=
appears=20
when you block the switch again. hci0 is set to "blocked" when it appea=
rs,=20
because the acer-wmi driver have registered acpi-bluetooth rfkill switc=
h=20
during boot, which was set to "blocked" initially with a call to=20
rfkill_init_sw_state. So what happens actually is this:

1) at boot, BIOS says the bluetooth is disabled, so the not-registered =
state=20
of acer-bluetooth rfkill is set to "blocked" (rfkill_init_sw_state, set=
s the=20
"persistent" bit). The acer-bluetooth is then registered, which forces =
the=20
global bluetooth state to go "blocked". No hci0 exists at this time.

2) when you press the button, hci0 appears and the rfkill is set to the=
 global=20
bluetooth state (in rfkill_sync_work), which is "blocked".

=46rom my understanding acer-wmi reports the change via acer_rfkill_upd=
ate work=20
(executed every second). It just calls rfkill_set_sw_state, but that do=
esn't=20
update the global state. I don't know at which time that happens, but=20
generally I didn't find anything that could eventually enable hci0 stat=
e or=20
global state to "unblocked".

Cheers,
Old=C5=99ich.
