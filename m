I have seen that this is a lot of work and I didn't think it was so 
complicated!
To get the GPIO support for APU2/APU3 merged into the gpio subsystem.
I am little confused what i should do now. By the way I only have one 
board (APU3).

>  - you need to support both

That is not necessary from my point of view. I am fine if the driver 
supports at least
the current BIOS version. And if the coreboot maintainer fixes the ACPI 
problem
then we could extend the driver and add the ACPI stuff.
But this not in my hand, right?

I will have a look how to achieve this.
If we want to support all BIOS version.
And is a must have to get the driver into mainline.

I do not understand how I could fix this. I have no idea from ACPI.
I have not found any driver where I can inspire myself.

That's maybe coming next when the coreboot maintainers have their bios 
fixed, right?
