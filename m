Well "the airplane mode" is well defined. It means no intentional
transmitting at radio frequencies.

The fact that you are allowed to use WIFI on certain flights does not
change anything.

I see that "airplane mode" trigger might be a tiny bit
useful... dunno, for a LED near the airplane mode switch, when vendor
replaced hardware toggle with a key. But policy should have nothing to
do with that. If you argue additional "policy daemon" is needed for
that... forget it, that's overdesigned.

(Besides, finding all LEDs with given trigger is trivial
operation. Besides... there should never be more than one).

Yes, so lets forget that and no additional triggers? Good ;-).
