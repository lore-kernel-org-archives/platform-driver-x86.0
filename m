It's a list_head and a ulong now.  That doesn't add up to 64.

If you properly describe the bounds and limits of banks we can possibly
help you find a nice solution.  As it stands, they are totally opaque
and we have no idea what is going on.

The page allocator can only do 4MB at a time.  Using your 64 byte
numbers: 4MB/64 = 64k sgx_epc_pages.  64k*PAGE_SIZE = 256MB.  So you can
only handle 256MB banks with this code.

BTW, if you only have 64k worth of pages, you can use a u16 for the index.

Plus comments, that would be nice.

So you're saying the one platform you looked at don't support hotplug.
I was looking for a more broad statement about SGX.
