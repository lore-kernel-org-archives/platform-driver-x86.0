Hmm, I take that back.
This still should get removed completely from:
Documentation/laptops/thinkpad-acpi.txt

These problems apply to all laptops and instead of adding pointers to all
Documentation/laptop/${vendor} files,
a separate file should be added. This should then be more about thermal
management problems in general and pointers to:
Documentation/acpi/ec_sysfs
and
Documentation/acpi/debug.txt
Documentation/acpi/*
added there looks like the appropriate solution to me.

If people agree:
  - This patch is still fine and should get applied as it is
  - I will send another patch adding some more documentation
    in some days

Thanks,

    Thomas
