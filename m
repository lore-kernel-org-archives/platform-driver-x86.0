Verified - I tried to compile rfkill as module as you recommended (on p=
ersonal=20
e-mail). I had to reload rfkill after startup to have rfkill listening.=
 So=20
this part looks clear on what happens.

@Joey Lee: There are other strange situations when I have rfkill as a m=
odule=20
and don't have acer-wmi loaded (every second try hci0 rfkill is blocked=
, the=20
other try it is unblocked) and more strange situation is when acer-wmi =
gets=20
loaded (accidentally I've tried it when the BT hci0 was up and running)=
 - the=20
BT switch brings hci0 to light after the second press (no action on the=
 first=20
one), next press switched it off. I was able to reproduce both "problem=
s"=20
several times with no randomness in it.
