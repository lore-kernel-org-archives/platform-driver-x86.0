With my current implementation (which I sent in this patch), they are=20
not fighting.

dell-smo8800 exports /dev/freefall (and nothing more) and lis3lv02d only=20
accelerometer device as lis3lv02d driver does not get IRQ number in=20
platform data.

No, Dell does not have any ACPI methods. And as I wrote in ACPI or DMI=20
is even not i2c address of device, so it needs to be specified in code=20
itself.

Really there is no other way... :-(

Such "generic" bridge is probably not possible, as /dev/freefall is=20
connected to specific lis3lv02d IRQ.
