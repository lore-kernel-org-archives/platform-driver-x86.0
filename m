The problems were exposed on newer XPS laptops because those platforms were not tested during platform development.  There really isn't a scalable way to represent whether a platform was or wasn't tested during development.  In a lot of situation things just work.  I would like to do the right thing for the users with what information and resources are available right now to put them in a better state.  An aggressive approach of not taking patches to cover a broken interface won't fix the problem of not testing machines already in the market, it will just put end users of the kernel module at a disadvantage.

The problem is this isn't something that can be quantified to match all different Dell laptops.  Specifications, ODMS, IBVs, and requirements change over time on different laptops so this kernel module is really just a line of best fit.  You can be sure the matching driver and tool on the windows side will rev and collect special case scenarios as laptops come out.  If you want to continue to best represent things going forward do this:

1) Don't blacklist any Latitude or Vostro.  These are tested during platform development.
2) Leave those compal_laptop supported ones blacklisted.
3) Blacklist 2010-2012 XPS.  These are currently not tested during platform development.
4) If problems start to show up on Inspiron, blacklist them invidually.  These platforms are currently tested during platform development though, so hopefully issues don't crop up.
