Indeed, I hadn't really thought of no ACPI support at all... I guess th=
e best
is to just do like the other config which select ACPI_WMI, make them de=
pend
on ACPI. Sounds good to you? (new version appended)

Many different modules depend on WMI. In Kconfig, some used to "depend"
on it, while others "selected" it. As WMI by itself is useless and more
like a library, it's easier for the user to have it automatically
selected whenever needed. It's especially true for options in completel=
y
different places (like LEDS_DELL_NETBOOKS). So we consistently "select"
it.

v2: depend on ACPI to avoid selecting ACPI_WMI without ACPI.
