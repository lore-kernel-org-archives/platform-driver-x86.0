In theory perhaps, but in practice, I doubt it. USB audio perhaps,
because that's at least ALSA. Bluetooth uses its own stack (it's not
even ALSA), and I'm not sure how much of that stack is in the kernel.

And then we haven't considered other oddities such as FFADO, network
connected devices and what not...but perhaps we could leave those out?

I say it's the *most* useful thing for it to do.

Imagine you're a non-technical user, who has never heard the words
"compromised userspace". You connect your headset where it fits (or
cordless), and then select the headset in sound settings (if it didn't
get selected for you when you plugged it in). You're on a VOIP call and
press the mic mute hotkey. Which mic did you expect to mute? The
selected one. On the mic mute hotkey button, there is also a LED. You
expect it to lit, because you muted the mic that you currently care
about, i e, the selected one.
