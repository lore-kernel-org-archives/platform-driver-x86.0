I did not say I can't use udev now,
just for in case someone can't.

actually, I am asking if CPU online/offline have real purpose,
you offline a CPU, then threads can't run on it,
you online a CPU, then threads can run on it,
so, the purpose here is just bouncing threads?
obviously not, any profound historical reasons?

I boldly think maybe online/offline should be integrated into
real plug/unplug process of CPU.

Thanks!
