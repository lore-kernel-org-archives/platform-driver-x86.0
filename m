Yes, those functions are internal used in acer-wmi, and acer_wmi_init
function will transfer all ACPI error to Linux style then send to
userland.
So, yes, there have no any issue even mix 2 different style return

I still replaced the -EINVAL with AE_ERROR because those 2 functions
declare return a acpi_status.


Thank's a lot!
