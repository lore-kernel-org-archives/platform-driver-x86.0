I once used bus_notifiers to achieve something similar. You could check
arch/arm/mach-shmobile/regulator-quirk-rcar-gen2.c to see an action
triggered once a client device got added, but you could act on another
action like BUS_NOTIFY_BOUND_DRIVER. I used exactly that, too, somewhen
somewhere.  Haven't checked if that helps here, too. And since we have 
a
precedence (Fujitsu case), I'll leave it to Jean who is the maintainer
of this driver.

Thanks,
