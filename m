Looks more fixed than on my S12, indeed.
I don't really speak AML, but while S10-3 ILDD (called from _CFG) seems
to read fixed values only, here on S12 PHSR (called from _CFG) seems to
do some kind of I/O operation. I'm not sure about this, but it somehow
looks like.

Why? The camera is always detected - bit 19 is always set, 0xc0000 and
0xd0000 only differ in bit 16. Bit 19 btw. seems to be the only fixed
bit in S12-VIA _CFG :)

Mh, judging from S12-VIA _CFG they definitely are zero here.

The bluetooth device seems not to initialize well enough to answer (110
is ETIMEDOUT).

No, when I said "does not appear again" and "it does not come back at
all" I meant I see not a single message in dmesg about anything
happening.

Hmmm, maybe provide a module parm to block rfkill devices and default it
to 1 on S12? Users would not need to care too much then but can change
it if they like...

Okay, did some more...

I played with the hardware killswitch under Linux. The bluetooth device
disappears and re-appears there and always seems to initialize
correctly. No USB read errors this way.

I also played with the soft killswitch under Windows. The bluetooth
device disappears from device manager and re-appears on unblock
(together with the Windows device plug sounds). This looks to me like
the ACPI killswitch is used for it.
No initialization-problems here, the device always comes back fully
operational. So, Windows doesn't seem to suffer from a bad
initialization.

I'm not exactly sure what this means - especially because I don't know
how the hardware killswitch works internally.
It *could* mean, the initialization problem is proably something that
could be dealt with in the USB layer long term (and would then probably
not have to be worked around anymore in ideapad_laptop). I'm not sure
about this, because this would mean the hard killswitch power-cut
somehow differs from the soft killswitch power-cut.
