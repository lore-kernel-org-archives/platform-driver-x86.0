yes, that would be a normal thermal cooling device driver. I will do
that first. Thanks for the suggestion.

The difference is one single knob (long term power limit) in the thermal
interface vs multiple fine grained control and data in the complete RAPL
interface.

Here is what a complete RAPL interface for package domain looks like.

yes, some of them such as limits. But not all the data in the list
above are suitable for thermal interface. That is why I am trying to
balance between abstracted generic data and RAPL specific data while
still allow linking between the two.

The way I envisioned how a thermal/power management app would use is:
1. go through generic thermal layer sysfs and find available RAPL
domains
2. if the app wants to do more fine grained control, it follows the
device symlink to locate the RAPL domain specific sysfs area.

why is that a one-off API? RAPL interface is maintained identical across
Intel CPUs after Sandy Bridges. I agree with you that it is still one
type of device with some of its data unique. Should i create a RAPL
class device?

I use kobjects mainly for its symlink to allow userspace locate the
'true' device behind generic thermal layers' cooling device.

the device directory contains the complete RAPL interface
representation. paste the example of package domain again.

RAPL domains can be viewed as sub devices of RAPL interface. On a given
platform they can be a complete or partial list of 
package, power plane 0 (processor core), power plane 1 (graphics),
dram controller, pch, etc.

Yes, I can create a RAPL class and create_device for each domain based
on 'struct device'. I can still use the kobj symlink to link to generic
thermal layer. I just thought it is an overkill as compared to
simply using kobjects and kset.

I don't understand the benefit of using 'struct device' in this
case. RAPL interface as a whole has its device, I am not creating
standalone kobjects.
