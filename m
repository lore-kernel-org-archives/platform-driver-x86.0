The Model is a VGN-TT15GN

My dsdt has been patched to recognise a new wireless card but is otherwise unmodified. Everything 
appears to work but I'll be adding a WWAN card and swapping the Wifi card in the next week or two, 
so we'll see how that goes.

The patch I was pointed at earlier seems to pretty much activate everything.

No manual fanspeed control. bluetoothpower does not seem to do anything. I don't have wwan installed 
yet, so I can't test wwanpower but I would have expected that to be controlled via rfkill.

I don't seem to be able to get the power consumption down below about 7W though. With Windows I can 
get it below 6W. I'll keep fiddling.

Interesting point. Windows sets up the graphics card in 16 bit mode to reduce power consumption. 
With X in 16 bit mode I seem to get about .5-.7W higher power consumption than in the default 24bit 
mode.
