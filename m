Thank you both for the follow-up here.

Kast,

You have some feedback from Corentin and myself on the basic driver, mostly
around cleanups for legibility and future maintainability. You also have
agreement to move forward with virt_to_phys() in the driver due to limitations
imposed by the vendor AML.

Please incorporate these changes in a v2 and resubmit the patch. Please keep all
those who have provided feedback on Cc, and include them in the Cc lines of the
patch itself (below your Signed-off-by).

Thanks,
