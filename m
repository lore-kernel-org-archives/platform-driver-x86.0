The ACPI specification [1] says the following:

"""
A valid PNP ID must be of the form =93AAA####=94 where A is an uppercase =
letter
and # is a hex digit.
A valid ACPI ID must be of the form =93ACPI####=94 where # is a hex digit=
=2E
"""

It don't says that the ACPI ID must be uppercase.

I don't have an older generation of the classmate laptop to test if the
ACPI ID is FnBT or FNBT, but I guess that if it was working until now, is=

because the older generations have FnBT instead of FNBT.

However I just found a previous discussion about this issue on LKML [2] a=
nd
seems that the patch is included (commit: 72638f5).

So... this means that the cmpc_keys module was not working for any
classmate laptop since ~2.6.29 ?

If that is the case then replacing FnBT with FNBT will be fine.

Thanks!

Best regards!
