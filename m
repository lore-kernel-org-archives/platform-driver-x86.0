You don't need to refresh the series in a hurry, unless you've got enough
reviews or may miss the cycle. Asking an LLM agent to refresh the series
is easy, but a human being needs time to review your series.

Please leave some time for others to respond.

If the firmware properly handles it when hw brightness !=3D 3, you can skip
led_classdev_{suspend,resume}() completely as long as the device supports
auto mode. They are only needed when the firmware doesn't take care of
the keyboard backlight. Skipping them should make our life mush easier.

Of course, we still need an approach to determine the support. That's why
we should leave some time for Vishnu and Mark to answer the question.

It is an unfortunate side-effect of the workqueue deferral mechanism.=C2=A0=
The
mechanism was introduced in order that:

- the LED driver can notify hw control change in an atomic context
- the LED driver can properly serialize notification handling, trigger
[de]activation, brightness_set[_blocking]() and hw_offloaded() callback
without worrying about lock reentrance

As for ideapad-laptop, it needs the second guarantee, as all said
functions or callbacks need to acquire the same mutex to prevent TOCTOU
issues.

IMHO the race condition is not a big deal. The interface was designed
with an assumption: it's the user who decides to press the shortcut
(Fn+Space) and/or select the trigger via sysfs. It can only be barely
reproduced in fuzz tests with scripts and robotic fingers, which is as
boring as fuzzing the bind/unbind interface to stress naive drivers...

That being said, I am thinking of working around this by querying
hw_offloaded() in the worker. I will find some time to prepare a patch to
see if the approach works and submit it. It won't change the interface,
so patches can be applied in an arbitrary order. Please ignore the issue
for the time being (OTOH, you don't need to rebase on top of the said
patch when it's ready).

Thanks,
Rong
