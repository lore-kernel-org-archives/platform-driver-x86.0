I meant to say "wrong place in ALSA subsystem".

We want to record state at mute-trigger side, yes. Should not be
really different from other triggers.

Yes.

As well as thinkpad; note I did not do that part, because I don't have
that LED on my test machine.

Anyway, normally we get the architecture right and only then we merge
the drivers.

All Huawei hackers need to do is to convert their driver into normal
LED driver, and test it with some other trigger (like heartbeat). Then
we can be fairly sure it will work when we get the micmute done.

As you will not change any core LED code, I don't think any heavy
synchronization with LED tree should be neccessary. We have LED
triggers living outside drivers/leds/triggers, too, such as
drivers/usb/common/led.c .

(Actually, that's the beauty of the LED subsystem. You have standard
trigger. You have standard LED -- which says it prefers that trigger if
available. They are really independend, so you can test and merge them
separately).

Let me know if you need any more help.

Best regards,
