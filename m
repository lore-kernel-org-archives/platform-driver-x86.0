These patches are diffed against the test branch of the ACPI tree, but also
patch fine with 2.6.35-rc3.

I thought about tainting the kernel if someone writes to the EC, but as
userspace can also write to graphics IO, PCI config or MSRs, it shouldn't
matter that much.
Eventually this should still be added (by a separate patch), one can easily
confuse the EC to not switch on the fans anymore.

A small tool to read out and write to /sys/devices/system/ec/*/io can be
found here:

Len: Can you apply these into your test branch and schedule them for linux-next
and 2.6.36 if there are no objections, please.

Thanks,

     Thomas
