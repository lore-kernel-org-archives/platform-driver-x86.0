The problem is that userspace programs responds to those keypresses when
they shouldn't.

In case of KEY_KBDILLUMTOGGLE, the illumination level is changed by the
BIOS, so if the keypress is reported, userspace programs will try to
toggle the keyboard illumination after the BIOS changed the level.
This is even more problematic if you consider that there could be
multiple illumination levels that are not taken into account if a
KEY_KBDILLUMTOGGLE is sent. Userspace will simply turn ON/OFF the
illumination, interfering with the BIOS.
This is shouldn't be a major problem since dell-laptop can control the
keyboard illumination only now and I can't see what userspace
application can misbehave without this change.

In the case of KEY_WLAN/KEY_RFKILL, the BIOS already takes care of
everything when the key is pressed, so sending keypresses as if
userspace programs have to do something is wrong. If for instance the
WiFi rfkill is soft blocked and I press the Fn key twice, I want it
to be soft blocked at the end. However, this is not the case.

Sorry for the brief commit messages.
