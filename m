I've got one similar report on IRC #bcm-users from Ideapad user. When
he booted with rfkill on, Broadcom was not visible in lspci at all.
Switching rfkill during working system didn't change anything. He had
to power down, switch rfkill off and boot.

Not sure about other situations. I asked him to post on b43 ML, but he =
didn't.
