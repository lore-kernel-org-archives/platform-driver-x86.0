The HCI and SCI form an integral part of the Toshiba configuration scheme,
the SCI has been present on any Toshiba branded laptop to date, what
was not present (at least on toshiba_acpi) was (propper) SCI support
until the patches I sent.

Take a look at Jonathan Buzzard documentation [1], and also the toshiba
module under char, the documentation was written in 1999, and the
module has a (starting) date of 1996.

By the time toshiba_acpi was written, only HCI functions were accessed,
as well as the configuration handle was (and still is, depending on model)
named GHCI, and so the comments refer to it, now that we have SCI
(driver support) on board, the naming seems obsolete, or at least
misguiding, as the HCI is not the only configuration interface.

Hope this clears things a bit.

Oh no, this is intentional, what I probably should have done here is be more
verbose about it, perhaps something like:

/*
 * The Toshiba configuration interface is composed of the HCI and the
 * SCI, which are defined as
