For $FUTURE GUIDs that approach could potentially work depending upon how
the different GUID's are segmented.  There's a few different approaches bei=
ng
discussed.

It unfortunately wouldn't work with the "current" stuff though if we go for=
ward
with the proposal to adjust dell-smbios to use the WMI calls too.
The SMBIOS GUID(A80593CE-A997-11DA-B012-B622A1EF5492) would get=20
taken by dell-smbios and hence not available to userspace.

It would be fine to restrict the event one (9DBB5994-A997-11DA-B012-B622A1E=
F5492).
The one the kernel sees as DESCRIPTOR_GUID can be used to provide static
Info, I don't think that's needed by userspace either.
