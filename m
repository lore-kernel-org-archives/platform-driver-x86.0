Yes.

1) These events do not happen 100s of times per second, they happen
almost never

2) This is the best we can do given the firmware interface we have

Again given the frequency of these events this is not really an issue.

Sure we can distuingish 2, 3 and 4.2 will always go through the kernel
and 1 and 4.1 will not, so we can just compare the last written value to
the value after the event, this works fine. There really is no problem here.

Granted using libsmbios to change things will cause the change to be
seen as an autonomous / firmware change rahter then done by userspace,
as you wrote yourself in a previous mail:

"Due to fundamental reasons we ignore all race condition between
libsmbios and kernel (they are basically not possible to solve). I'm
fine with this."

This is unsolvable, but the end result is that other userspace bits
(if present) may mistake the change for an autonomous change and
show the OSD, so the only bad side-effect is the OSD being shown
in that case. And I really doubt this will ever happen, either the
user uses something like GNOME and he will likely never use libsmbios
directly, or he runs some more DIY desktop environment and does
use smbiosctl in which case no one will be listening for the
autonomous changes.

That is not true, the hw_brightness_changed attribute returns the last
brightness passed to led_classdev_notify_brightness_hw_changed(), this
is the whole reason why it has a brightness argument, this is actually
done to avoid races, so that we get the brightness asap after receiving
the event and then even if userspace takes it sweet time we actually
report the brightness resulting from the event and not some later
change (this is part of the ABI definition of brightness_hw_changed).

So no we do not end up doing 2 SMBIOS calls and even if we were
given the frequency of these events the performance impact would be
absolutely negligible.

You are really seeing a lot of problems where there are none,
remember Linus' motto: perfect is the enemy of good.

Now can we please move forward with this ?

Hans
