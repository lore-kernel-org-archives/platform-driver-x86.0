Hi Rafael, Andy,

For the why and what of this patch see the (somewhat long) commit message.

The single patch in this set both touches drivers/acpi/scan.c and
drivers/platform/x86/intel_cht_int33fe.c, this is done this way to avoid
regressions when bisecting.

The main change here really is to ACPI change and intel_cht_int33fe.c is
modified to follow suit. Also I do not expect intel_cht_int33fe.c to see
much changes this cycle. As such I believe it would be best to merge this
patch through Rafael's tree (after review).

Andy is that ok with you and we have your ack for this?

Regards,

Hans
