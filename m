This series adds suport for power and volume buttons on 5th and 6th
generation Microsoft Surface devices. Specifically, it adds support for
the power-button on the Surface Laptop 1 and Laptop 2, as well as
support for power- and (on-device) volume-buttons on the Surface Pro 5
(2017), Pro 6, and Book 2.

These devices use the same MSHW0040 device as on the Surface Pro 4,
however, whereas the Pro 4 uses an ACPI notify handler, the newer
devices use GPIO interrupts to signal these events.

The first patch of this series ensures that the surfacepro3_button
driver, used for MSHW0040 on the Pro 4, does not probe for the newer
devices. The second patch adapts soc_button_array to implement the
actual button support.

I think the changes to soc_button_array in the second patch warrant a
thorough review. I've tried to make things a bit more generic to be able
to integrate arbitrary ACPI GPIO power-/volume-button devices more
easily, I'm not sure if there may be reasons against this.

These patches have also been tested on various Surface devices via the
github.com/jakeday/linux-surface patchset.

Changes since v1:
  - [PATCH 1/2] platform: Fix device check for surfacepro3_button
    No changes.

  - [PATCH 2/2] input: soc_button_array for newer surface devices
    Ensure the patch compiles without CONFIG_ACPI.
