Yeah, I get that now. =C2=A0It's just that to me, something called
"AIRPLANE_MODE_CHANGE" seems like it should actually change airplane
mode on/off, which implies killing radios. =C2=A0I wouldn't have had th=
e
problem if it was named AIRPLANE_MODE_INDICATOR_CHANGE, which makes it
clear this is simply an indicator and has no actual effect on anything
other than a LED.
