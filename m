This is my "fault", I asked Paul to rebase on top of
review-andy as that had 1 new silead_dmi patches missing
from testing, so otherwise we would end up with a conflict when
merging review branches. Same reason why I've been basing my
silead_dmi patches on top of review-andy even though that is
an unusual base to use.

Hans
