It looks reasonable, don't worry about it.

This is weird, brightness level should be ~75%.

even more weird. I don't know if IGID has changed in the meantime, but 
there's something not working properly elsewhere. But definitely it's 
not a problem belonging to sony-laptop or video (which should be used 
because SBRT/GBRT methods, with 0 based values and 9 values range, pose 
problems with the current backlight device implementation in sony-laptop).

The patches attached by Rui. Sorry but I can't help further.
