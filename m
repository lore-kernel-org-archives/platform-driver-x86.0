They comes from some Windows Dell GUI utility. It is not=20
documented in libsmbios project and people behind libsmbios do=20
not know why only those values are accepted by BIOS for XPS=20
laptop...

BIOS bug (or BIOS feature?). No idea. For invalid value on XPS=20
BIOS just reset keyboard backlight to someting default...

>=20

There are two interfaces how to set keyboard backlight. Both are=20
documented above. One via kbd mode and one via kbd level. Some=20
laptops (e.g my E6440) support only kbd mode and some (e.g XPS)=20
support only kbd level. So we need to implement both interfaces=20
in kernel if we want to support as more machines as possible.

>=20

Because if maximum possible kbd level is 0 then we cannot use it.

When laptop does not support configuring keyboard backlight=20
level. You can see that in documentation are more properties=20
which can be configured, so if BIOS tell us that this one (level)=20
does not support we cannot change it.

Some bits are reserved for future use (now undocumented). So once=20
we know what they means we can adjust global enum/macro and=20
changing this for loop will not be needed.=20

>=20

I tried to write general code which check all possible modes if=20
they are of type which configure level. And because some of them=20
are undocumented I used this approach, so in future global=20
enum/macro could be extended.

>=20

Reserved for off mode -- keyboard backlight turned off.

kbd level is for laptops which support kbd level. kbd mode is for=20
laptops which support setting level via kbd mode.

>=20

We know that BIOSes are buggy, so I can imagine that off mode=20
(which is enum =3D 0) does not have to be supported... So for=20
kbd_mode_levels[0] we set first supported mode (if off is not=20
supported we will choose something other, so kernel code will not=20
call unsupported mode).
