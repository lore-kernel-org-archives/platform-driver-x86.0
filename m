=46irst, I am sorry for I forgot to add Alan and also a bit of late to =
add
Cc. you and other rfkill experts, and thank's for your response.

I will keep it in mind to remember add Cc to patch contributor in the
future.

Emit needlessly KEY_BLUETOOTH when acer-wmi initial may not a good idea
if there have any userland daemon to listen the keycode.

I am trying to remove rfkill_init_sw_state then workaround this issue
in .set_block by maintain a driver initial flag in acer-wmi.

Does it possible we add this rfkill module option for user can control
disable rfkill-input when rfkill driver probed?

Because, distro was shipped with different company's machine, like: Ace=
r
or MSI, different machines almost have different wifi/bluetooth/wwan ke=
y
use case.
Sometimes, we want to use rfkill-input, but sometimes we have userland
GUI application to provide rfkill control panel to end user. We already
used urfkill daemon to disable rfkill-input by ioctl way, but like this
issue, it was happen on driver probe.

Different acer machine have different behavior, but I don't know have
Acer machine emit more then one key event in function key. I know have
some MSI netbook emit more then one key event.

But,=20
this bluetooth killswitch state issue is not relate to emit more then
one event.


Thank's a lot!
