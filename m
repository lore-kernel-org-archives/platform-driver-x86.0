It has ->remove() hook, so, definitely it's possible to unbind.

Here is the problem with CLK framework since it's (was?) too oriented
to ARM and clock trees.

The best option for x86 is to place it in some platform code, which is
bad idea per se.
For example, GPIO, PWM, etc have static look up tables and glue
drivers (like PCI part of the driver, or I2C, or similar) can fill
that table based on ID.

My personal opinion that the best place is not the clock driver for
that, rather converting existing drivers to take clock name based on
some (platform related) ID.
