Doesn't look so - at least haven't found anything where it's
automatically selected on x86. OTOH, that wouldn't make much
sense to me  - I somewhat doubt that x86 can't run w/o that.

Maybe ACPI selects it (haven't checked yet), but my driver is
completely independent from ACPI (the board's BIOS doesn't
provide any useful entries here), ACPI isn't x86 specific
(anymore), and I'd guess x86 boards can run w/o ACPI.
(actually, I'm considering hacking up a completely oftree
based bootup on x86 ;-)).

IMHO, dependencies should always be direct - indirect ones could
suddenly change in subtle ways.

Yeah, that's a really helpful tool. Maybe I should do some more
automatisation on handling/editing whole patch queues ...
(unless somebody else already did it).

Is there some standard rule on this ? Maybe something that checkpatch.pl
could automatically catch ?

Yep, forgot to clean that up.

Okay, wasn't sure about that, so I preferred defensive programming.

Could I also leave that field untouched (IOW: =0) ?

See other mails.
Need to pass in the board specific register assignments.

Done. I had to patch gpio-keys-polled driver first.
