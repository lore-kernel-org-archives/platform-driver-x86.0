Hi Daniel,

I had a quick chat with Bastien about this. The conclusion was that
reusing the TOGGLE key may be problematic for gnome-settings-daemon.
And the alternative of a new CYCLE key also has some caveats.

The most straight forward solution is likely to simply handle the
brightness change in the kernel and not report the key to userspace at
all. This should work just fine and at least GNOME will show an on
screen display in response to the brightness change.

Do you think that approach would work well?

Benjamin
