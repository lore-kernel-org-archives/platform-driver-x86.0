Specifically, _WDG is a method which evaluates to a buffer [1], and it is this
buffer which Pali would like to see exported via sysfs.

This data block provides a description (array of structs) for each data block,

and this ID and data type provide the mapping needed to identify the
enable/disable and control ACPI method names.
