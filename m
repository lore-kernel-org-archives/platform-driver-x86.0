Unless you can not boot your machine without this, you should never
default to y.  Just delete this line.

Why?  I think you need to remove this line :)

How nice, you just crashed a machine, rendering it useless to get the
bug report out of.  Never do that in a driver.  This is a static
function, that you control the values being sent to it, you should never
have to do such strict parameter checking with this line, or all of the
other lines you have in this function.  You _know_ that they will never
be hit, so don't even check for them.

In Linux we do (rp->name == NULL), or even better yet (!rp->name),
please fix that up here and elsewhere in the driver.

dev_err() instead?  Same with the other pr_* calls, almost all of them
can be dev_*.

No one cares.  If a driver is working properly, it should NEVER print
anything out, even the "I'm now loaded, look at ME!" lines.

You didn't just do this...

{sign}

As per the documentation in the kernel tree, I get to publicly mock you
and this code, in which you feel you are somehow smarter than the kernel
by having to 'trick' it by providing an empty release function, thereby
shutting the message it used to give you up.

Do you really think I just put that error message in there for fun?  You
need to think that it was trying to tell you something, and providing an
empty function is NOT what it is trying to tell you, that would be flat
out stupid of it to do.

Surely this didn't pass any internal Intel review, did it?

Fix this now, it's totally unacceptable.

> +MODULE_VERSION("0.1");

No one cares about the module version, just delete it.

Not needed, use MODULE_BUILD_NAME or some such thing.

We have BIT definitions, why not use them?

The only thing in this platform data .h file, should be platform data,
not structures and definitions and enums, they should all be within the
.c file as no one else cares about them.

C has named initializers, use them please.
