The infrastructure is used in the sense that it allows us to split the
userspace-facing code, i.e. the driver, into a separate module.  This
in turn allows virtualization of SGX without having to load the driver
or building it in the first place, e.g. to virtualize SGX on a system
that doesn't meet the driver's requirements.

We could eliminate the abstraction by moving the EPC management code
into the driver, but that would directly conflict with past feedback
and would need to be completely undone to enable KVM.  The abstraction
could be dumbed down to a single function, but as mentioned earlier,
that comes with its own costs.  I can dive into exactly what we lose
with a single function approach if this is a sticking point.
