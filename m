OK good. Let's just get the quirk a comment so it's clear why it's nece=
ssary.

At the very least, let's get a comment block describing these and the t=
wo
interfaces. It wasn't clear to me from the big block of register descri=
ption
that there were two separate interfaces.

=46air enough. I won't bike shed this.

This sort of defensive programming is good, but it does need a comment.

/*
 * Find the first supported mode and assign to kbd_mode_levels[0].
 * This should be 0 (off), but we cannot depend on the BIOS to
 * support 0.
 */

And I think you've addressed this comment above.

So in general, whenever you're working around bugs in firmware or hardw=
are or
doing anything that might not be obvious to someone reviewing your code=
 without
all the context you've built up, it's important to add a comment explai=
ning why.
