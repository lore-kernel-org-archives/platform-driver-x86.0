I haven't followed the conversation you're having with Greg, but I would
be grateful if you'd test _just_ my patch. Unless someone jumps in and
points to flaws in my patch, that is.

I suppose testing would mean writing some values to the related files
under /sys. I have no idea whatsoever what those files actually do, so
I'm afraid I can't tell you what values to write and what effects to
expect, sorry. Perhaps someone else can help you there.
