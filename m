Just add on top of what Daren mentioned in another mail, based on the Quark document,
the base address can start from zero. Say lo=0, hi=0, and WM & RM may be changed from default value, 
1st 1KiB will be marked as IMR. It seems to me that there is no good way to test if an IMR is 'occupied' and/or 'enabled'
since enable-bit is not available. But, what is benefit of testing against lo=0 & hi=0? The logic to calculate size will work under
lo=0 & hi=0 anway.

I do agree on the benefit listed above. Perhaps, you can add explanation here
to mention the design decision.
