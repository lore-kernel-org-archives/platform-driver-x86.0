I think the following tells me firmware is sending them.  If I leave
acpi_osi=3D"Windows 2009" so that eeepc_laptop doesn't get loaded, I se=
e
events like this on /pro/acpi/event:

video LCDD 00000087 00000000
video LCDD 00000087 00000000
video LCDD 00000086 00000000
video LCDD 00000086 00000000

Thats a couple decreases followed by a couple increases.

If I change acpi_osi=3D"!Windows 2009" with and without
acpi_backlight=3Dvendor then I get events like:

hotkey ATKD 00000027 00000000
hotkey ATKD 00000026 00000000
hotkey ATKD 00000025 00000000
hotkey ATKD 00000024 00000000

The main difference is that with acpi_backlight=3Dvendor then I also ge=
t
events sent on /dev/input/event*.

=46rom here, I'd have to compile some custom eeepc-laptop's and see if
bd->props.brightness is being updated with correct values and then we
could do just the event send while skipping the update part.

=2E..or is there a way to not register for events 0x20 to 0x2f and let
ACPI Video process those?  If later is more correct way, is it obvious
why that code isn't sending key events today?
