I totally agree with the concern that Rob expressed about handling USB C
muxes in a non-adhoc way. And this makes this series scary. I don't know
enough details about USB C muxes and PD (I just have a very superficial
mental model) to tell if this series is going down the right path. Or
how terrible it will be to fix things up if not?

The series extends the mux subsystem with muxes that pins semantics
to specific states. That is new, and shows up exactly here when Rob is
not happy about the binding. And if Rob does not want this in the
DT bindings then I'm not so sure it is wise to do it at all? This
problem doesn't go away just because you remove the binding. I think
I would feel much better if there was a path forward on how to
represent USB C muxes in DT and how that would fit with the driver
structure.

If you compare to the i2c-muxes, there is a relatively new i2c-mux-gpmux
driver that uses some general purpose mux from the mux subsystem to
implement an i2c-mux. If USB C muxes where to be done similarly, I'd
imagine there should be a general abstraction of what USB C muxes provide
somewhere outside of the mux subsystem, and a bunch of implementations
of that abstraction. One of those implementations could be to use "raw"
muxes from the mux subsystem. Of course, this is not what this series is
doing.

Also, muxes that are not general purpose such as the ones added to the
mux subsystem by this series could perhaps be repurposed for some other
application, but since the interface implemented does not really obey
the rules (the provided mux controller interacts with different sets of
signals depending on the state) this will not be possible.

These issues are what has caused me to do a lot of thinking and to sit
silent, sorry about that, but I would like input from someone more
experienced. If possible. But I'm not sure where to turn?

As a crazy example, why is it not possible to hook up one signal pair
from the USB C mux, not to DP, but instead to some I2C controller? Then,
if done right, i2c-mux-gpmux could be hooked up with the relevant mux
controller and use the signal pair for I2C, with the mux controller
acting as a gate. So, maybe a bit crazy, but something like that is how
I think it should work from the mux subsystem point of view. And while
maybe crazy and while it might not be technically possible to do I2C
over a USB C connector for some reason, I do think that whatever
abstraction you come up with for USB C muxes, it has to deal with and
broker requests from both the USB subsystem and whatever other
subsystems deals with the alt pairs. Be it graphics for DP signals, or
whatever. IIUC, the alt signals need not be graphics, and it would be
sad to implement the USB C mux it in a way that makes it hard to use
the alt pairs for something else.

[maybe my understanding of USB C is just wrong]

Peter
