If you are changing what the functions return in this patch, you also need to
update the call sites at the same time (same patch).

The full text of the comment above is:

/* common hci tasks (get or set one or two value)
 *
 * In addition to the ACPI status, the HCI system returns a result which
 * may be useful (such as "not supported").
 */

Is this no longer relevant?

I agree that the return and status approach seems suboptimal, but I'm not clear on the motivation for the change. Is there something besides cleanup you're attempting to work toward with this series?
