Unfortunately, this is not how it should be fixed.

First of all, we (Heikki, Sathya, me =E2=80=94  all in Cc list) that this
driver should be refactored and unified with intel_scu_ipc.
Then, it has two drivers inside and PCI is just a glue for it which is
optional. Thus, needs to be split accordingly.
