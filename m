In fact they are the same watchdog device. The only difference is the
"secondary enable" which controls whether the watchdog causes a reboot
or just raises an alarm. The alarm feature is not even implemented in
the given driver, we just enable that secondary enable regardless.

In one range of devices (227E) that second enable is part of a
pio-based control register. On the other range (427E) it unfortunately
is a P2SB gpio, which gets us right into the discussion we have around
the LEDs.
With that i have my doubts that two drivers would be the way to go,
most likely not. 

Only that i have no clue which pinctrl driver should be used here. My
guess is "sunrisepoint" because the CPUs are "SkyLake" i.e. i5-6442EQ,
i3-6102E
And "grep INT344B /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/DSDT" matches. I booted a
kernel patched with the series from Andy but the "pinctrl-sunrisepoint"
does not seem to even claim the memory. Still trying to understand how
to make use of these pinctrl drivers they are in place but i lack
example users (drivers). If they should be available in sysfs, i might
be looking at the wrong place ... /sys/class/gpio/ does not list
anything

Henning
