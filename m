I tried a few more things, but ultimately failed to find a nice way to
implement this.

Another issue popped up, though.  Linus' master branch contains a recent
commit by Benjamin Tissoires (CC'ed), 4d5538f5882a ("i2c: use an IRQ to
report Host Notify events, not alert") which breaks your patch.  The
reason for that is that lis3lv02d relies on the i2c client's IRQ being 0
to detect that it should not create /dev/freefall.  Benjamin's patch
causes the Host Notify IRQ to be assigned to the i2c client your patch
creates, thus causing lis3lv02d to create /dev/freefall, which in turn
conflicts with dell-smo8800 which is trying to create /dev/freefall
itself.
        
Also, just to make sure we do not overthink this, I understand that not
every unit of the models from the whitelist has an accelerometer,
correct?  In other words, could we perhaps skip the part where we are
making sure the SMO88xx ACPI device is there?

I did some tests with evtest and it seems that axis values are
consistent with laptop's movements, so I think it is safe to whitelist
Vostro V131 with i2c address 0x1d.
