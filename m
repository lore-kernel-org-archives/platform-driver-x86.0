Pali has raised a very good point which I want to get some feedback from Linus,
and perhaps tglx, hpa, and gregkh on. While Mario is expressing a very pragmatic
approach which I certainly appreciate, we have a very strong position that we do
not break userspace.

There have been exceptions for specific pseudo filesystems and such, but they
are rare. We would need to document the WMI commitment from the kernel to
userspace (e.g. any call may be filtered based on current Linux kernel WMI
usage, which may change over time). This sounds troublesome... will give this
some more thought.

It might be moot with Christoph's dynamic ID comment which I need to go review
in detail. Putting that aside for a moment, what I intended was for the platform
driver to whitelist GUIDs. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it has an explicit
list. The platform driver could have a blacklist and then walk through all
available GUIDs and export everything except those on the blacklist.

Now with Christoph's idea, we may be able to maintain a blacklist of GUIDs and a
whitelist of platforms which CAN export WMI, but not export any until userspace
requests a specific GUID be exported at which point it is checked against the
blacklist and then exported accordingly, at which point the WMI method filters
handle the rest.
