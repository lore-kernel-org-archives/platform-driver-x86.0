Agreed.

I think you can do the crypto stuff... as crypto already verifies the
results. But I don't think you can do the computation offload.

distcc on untrusted nodes ... oh yes, that would be great.

Except that you can't do it, right? :-).

First, AFAICT it would be quite hard to get gcc to run under SGX. But
maybe you have spare month or three and can do it.

But ... you really can't guarantee getting right results. Evil owner
of the machine might intentionaly overheat the CPU, glitch the power,
induce single-bit errors using gamma source, ... You can't do it.
