I also agree the AIRPLANE_MODE_INDICATOR_* prefix makes things more
clear here. Thanks for the feedback, Dan!

Initially I have thought about creating and additional RFKill switch
for that, but I think it would be a bit hackish since we would have to
treat it specially in sysfs attributes and probably other places, and
userspace would also need a special case when going through the list
of RFKill switches in the system. The proposed solution has equivalent
semantics to an RFKill switch, is backward-compatible (users would
only ignore the unknown operations and evens -- although gsd has a
"default:" case to abort execution on an unknown event) and does not
extend the RFKill event struct.

One alternative would be to move the control point to a separate
device, like /dev/rfkill-airplane-mode, but I'm not sure this is a
very elegant approach. Anyway, I'm open to work on changes to the API,
but it would be great if you could at least pick or reject the
non-polemical patches of the series, so I don't need to carry them
anymore.
