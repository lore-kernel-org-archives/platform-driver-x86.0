It does not currently. However, the firmware is being developed along
with the hardware and the OS. We have the opportunity to do whatever
makes the most sense.

My next-steps here were to get a basic ACPI ID setup for each of the
three drivers just so they could be enumerated over ACPI rather than
just loaded manually. Beyond that I'll be looking to Len and Rafael for
guidance.
