As a general rule, Andy and I should be adding Cc stable to most anything that
includes a Fixes tag that isn't from this review cycle. I've forgotten in the
past as well - sorry about that. Something we should add some tooling around I
think, so we don't miss it when checking things in to our review branches.

As to timing. As soon as this is merged to Linus' master, it can go to stable.
Instructions for doing this are in Documentation/process/stable-kernel-rules.rst
