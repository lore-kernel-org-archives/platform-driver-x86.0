Thanks Hans. To expand on this:
libinput has heuristics to guess which input devices (keyboards, touchpads)
are built-in ones. When the tablet mode switch is on, we disable these
devices internally (this is not visible to callers), and re-enable it again
later when the tablet mode switch is off again.

This is done for keyboards and touchpads atm (and I think pointing sticks)
and where the heuristics fail we have extra quirks in place. For example
the Lenovo Yogas tend to disable the keyboard mechanically in tablet mode
but buttons (e.g. volume keys) around the screen send events through the
same event node. So on those devices we don't disable the keyboard.

We've had this code for a few years now and the only changes to it have been
the various device quirks for devices that must not suspend the keyboard,
it's otherwise working as expected.

If we ever have a device where we need to disable parts of the keyboard
only, we could address this with EVIOCSMASK but so far that hasn't been
necessary.

I agree with Hans, right now I don't see the usefulness of this new sysfs
toggle. For it to be really useful you'd have to guarantee that it's
available for 100% of the devices and that's IMO unlikely to happen.

Cheers,
