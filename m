Only few devices / device-drivers have / need firmware which is
embedded in the system-fw. Checking for this introduces an extra call
in the firmware-loader path and the firmware-loader maintainer have
requested to make this opt-in, rather then opt-out, so that these changes
do not impact the many many other drivers which do not need this.

To be precise so far only the 2 touchscreen drivers for which patches
are in this series are known to benefit from this approach. So since this
is somewhat of a special case opt-in makes more sense then opt-out.

Regards,

Hans
