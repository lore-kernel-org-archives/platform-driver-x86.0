Thank you for the review and sorry for being a bit slow with responding
I've been quite busy with other stuff.

Works for me, intel_atomisp2_pm it is for v2 of this patch.

I don't look adding deps / conflucts on options which are
not present upstream, so I'm going to keep this as for v2.

That would need to be time_before then, since the time check is a timeout
and then I would need to re-check the time outside the loop to see if
a timeout happened. So I believe it would better to keep this as is.
