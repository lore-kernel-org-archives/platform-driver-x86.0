Oh, I assumed the bottleneck is developer time, not lack of hardware...

Looks right, mine is E200HA-FD0004TS but I think that just means dark blue color.

There are reports hibernate isn't working, presumably because
the storage is 32MB eMMC.  I've never tried.  It doesn't
support ACPI S3 (suspend-to-RAM).  So currently one has
to boot+shutdown everytime (or keep it running).

1. There seems to be no way to wake it up after "echo freeze >/sys/power/state".
   That is the reason for wanting the power button to wake it up.
   Whether the PB creates an input event is secondary.
   (the LID also doesn't wake it up, but it creates an input event)
2. I've no idea what would be the power consumption in freeze state,
   so I guess support for the S0ix states is needed
3. It randomly hangs at boot, often with a message related to i2c timeout.
   I tried Hans de Goede's patches but it didn't work for me
   (question is if the semphore address is the same for
   AXP288 and TI DCove; the DSDT has the _SEM method so the
   semphore is needed).

Everything else is secondary.  E.g. there is an ADC driver used for thermal
used by the opregion driver, I didn't port it and just implemented
like for AXP288 by simple register reads (which might not work for TI).
We could fix this later.


Thanks,
Johannes
