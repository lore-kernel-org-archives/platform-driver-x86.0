If it is true that Windows will execute this code without error, then ACPICA should be changed to match the Windows behavior. ACPICA is now a "Windows compatible" implementation of ACPI, but that of course means we are attempting to be compatible with a black box ACPI implementation. On the other hand, it may be the case that Windows never executes this code, so the error is not seen on Windows.

We would like to investigate this further. Please send or point me to the acpidump for this machine.

Thanks,
Bob
