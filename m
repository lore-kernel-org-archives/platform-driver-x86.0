Oh, sorry.  It was a direct mail to Matthew, not on a list.  My mistake=
=2E

Basically, it consisted of this:

"OK, so digging through the platform list, here are the patches that se=
em
to be bugfixes that should probably go into 3.3:

http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.acpi.devel/51594
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.platform.x86.devel/2908
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.platform.x86.devel/2943
(replaces 3aa4634c0f23593c5be7e819e02dd6ace671820a in your
linux-next/for_linus branches)


=46or 3.4, these seem ready (in addition to what you have in linux-next=
):
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.platform.x86.devel/2968
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.platform.x86.devel/2888
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.platform.x86.devel/2934
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.platform.x86.devel/2929
"

I might spend some time today creating a fixed up git tree with that se=
t of
changes/patches and see what comes of it.
