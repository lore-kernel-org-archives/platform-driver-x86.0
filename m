Can be. You've actually caught me out there, function name is "imr_del"
function description says imr_del_range(). Amazing to think I proof read
this file a number of times for exactly thing type of thing

I'm happy with

imr_add_range();
imr_remove_range();

I don't see why not. I'll kill this header and call out to
x86_match_cpu() in the Galileo and IMR code.

Yes I could. Originally wrote the code with a pre-increment and then
changed the flow later on. Post-increment will work just as good now and
is more readable.

Since reg is incrementing on each iosf_mbi_dothing() that can work.

Sure. A separate integer isn't required, I can make that change.

Doesn't change the logic so yeah, works for me.

Appreciated, you're right globals are bad.

I think in this case the mutex at that scope is necessary though. Same
with the debugfs handle.

Will change.

No not planning to extend.
OK with the one file.

Ah - wasn't aware of that.
Great stuff - I'll kill the ifdefs - thanks !

Yep will do

Hmm - I nope - dump_stack() isn't relevant since it's an in-kernel API.
Did an unthinking copy/past from the mtrr code

I'll zap that.

Good catch.

Agree - I like that change.
Waste of time to complete the loop if an overlap is detected.
