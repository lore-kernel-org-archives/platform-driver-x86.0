Ok. Just wanted you to see it.

I have no idea.

It behaves just like 3.3. What might be interesting is 3.1. Here some
really strange values get returned:

[root@vpcs nv_backlight]# cat actual_brightness brightness max_brightness=

1073864551
1073864551
1025

When setting brightness to something between 0 and 1025, the screen is
basically black. At least there seems to be no backlight.

Any chance to get this thing sorted, so the right way of control will be
reported to Gnome (or for that matter any other instance in control of
brightness).

I'm currently trying to reconstruct the last version that worked for me.
I'm quite sure that "vaio-full-3.0.4.patch" (from here [1]), worked fine
with the 3.1.x branch. However I've just recompiled 3.1.10 and it
doesn't seem to work. Anyway it worked without the
"acpi_backlight=3Dvendor" parameter, so I'm not quite sure whether this i=
s
of interest for you right now.

Best regards,
