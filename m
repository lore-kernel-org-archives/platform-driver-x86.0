We can do that, yes.

Alternatively, we could do some magic so that kbd-backlight trigger is
not available for other leds, and that _only_ kbd-backlight trigger is
available for leds that are always controlled by the hardware. But we
can do that in future patch...

I certainly like the interface from thedescription.
