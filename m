Henrique/Yves-Alexis,

Yes, the V series systems are listed under Ideapad series on Lenovo's 
website. I initially was looking at why the Fn+F5 hotkey was not reporting 
a key event. Looking at the bios dsdt.dsl data on V480 I see

Device (HKEY)
                     {
                         Mutex (BFWM, 0x07)
                         Name (INDV, Zero)
                         Name (_HID, EisaId ("LEN0068"))
                         Method (_STA, 0, NotSerialized)

and it does not have the acpi_device_id of VPC2004 like other ideapads 
that I have seen, and seemed like the HKEY could be handled by 
thinkpad_acpi module. Product version string in DMI says "Lenovo V480" 
instead of "ThinkPad" and this was not recognized by the thinkpad_acpi 
module, thus my quirk to load the module.

After loading the module on the V480 I see:

[14511.946260] thinkpad_acpi: ThinkPad ACPI Extras v0.24
[14511.946262] thinkpad_acpi: http://ibm-acpi.sf.net/
[14511.946264] thinkpad_acpi: ThinkPad BIOS H5ET23WW (0.23 ), EC unknown
[14511.946265] thinkpad_acpi: Lenovo Lenovo V480, model 14TD010
[14511.946707] thinkpad_acpi: detected a 8-level brightness capable 
ThinkPad
[14511.952009] thinkpad_acpi: rfkill switch tpacpi_bluetooth_sw: radio is 
unblocked
[14511.953099] Registered led device: tpacpi::thinklight
[14511.953156] Registered led device: tpacpi::power
[14511.953203] Registered led device: tpacpi::standby
[14511.953247] Registered led device: tpacpi::thinkvantage
[14511.953262] thinkpad_acpi: Standard ACPI backlight interface available, 
not loading native one
[14511.953420] thinkpad_acpi: Console audio control enabled, mode: monitor 
(read only)
[14511.955196] input: ThinkPad Extra Buttons as 
/devices/platform/thinkpad_acpi/input/input17

Fn+F15 now reports key press event, 00000080 00001005, and it reported 
nothing before when the module was not loaded. So prior to loading 
thinkpad_acpi, /lib/udev/findkeyboards == input/event3, /lib/udev/keymap 
-i input/event3 returned no valid values for Fn+F5 combo.

I am trying to get this patched module tested on other thinkpad and 
ideapads that we have to see if there are any regression or other issues. 
So, please let me know if this something worth supporting.


Thanks
Manoj
