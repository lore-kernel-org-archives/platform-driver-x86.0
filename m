Hi Pali, Glenn,

Thanks for your feedback.

So we have more voices against the trigger approach.

I would also appreciate your opinion on the other solution to the
problem of notifying brightness changes originating from hardware,
i.e. hw_brightness_change{_ro} file, that would support POLLPRI events,
and reading brightness.

Do you find the file name informative enough or maybe you'd like to
propose other name, or even entirely different approach?
