Yeah, this seems fine. I'm not sure really quite what the difference
between the state and OP_CHANGE_ALL would be, but using the state does
seem reasonable to me. I also agree it's not really policy. In a sense
though, one might argue that it encourages the wrong policy.

As Marcel said, the question is whether or not a physical LED with an
airplane icon really should be lit when all the radios are off, or
should instead be lit when the system is in an "airplane safe" mode.
Consider, for example, an Android phone: You can quite easily display
both the WiFi connection icon and the airplane icon.

Mostly correct, yes. I'd argue that it should come with the following
semantics:
=C2=A0* default to the state of all as you described, so that without a=
ny
=C2=A0 =C2=A0userspace you still get some kind of sane default behaviou=
r
=C2=A0* allow only a single userspace owner, and require that owner to
=C2=A0 =C2=A0toggle it as required, to avoid multiple userspace applica=
tions
=C2=A0 =C2=A0stepping on each others' toes. This could be implemented b=
y making
=C2=A0 =C2=A0this a new /dev/rfkill command, and requiring the fd to be=
 held
=C2=A0 =C2=A0open while controlling the airplane mode state.

This would be the most generic solution, starting with the default
behaviour you implemented but allowing userspace to implement its own
airplane mode semantics without having to know about the platform LEDs
etc.

We could even do that in two stages, with your (updated) patch as the
first stage.

I would want to see some interest from userspace (e.g. Marcel for
connman) though before implementing that.
