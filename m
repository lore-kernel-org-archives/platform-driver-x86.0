Yes.

We are talking about the i2c bus in the Linux driver model sense, i.e.

	extern struct bus_type i2c_bus_type;

No I2C hardware is needed at this time.

If you take a look at next you will see that we no longer register bus
notifier unconditionally. I also thought that Hans was going to annotate
most of the items as __initconst so that unneeded memory can be
discarded after boot, but for that some other patches to device
properties should trickle through various subsystems. In the end you'll
end up with just the properties for the board you need.

So the idea is that I am trying to make drivers in input/
platform-independent, and move platform quirks out of them. With generic
device properties we can finally move away from ad-hoc platform data,
and rely on proper bindings, and that ensures at least some engineering
control.

So while looking for the ACPI companion device might be indeed very
easy, it pushes dependencies on ACPI and platform knowledge into the
generic driver, which I am trying to avoid. I believe
drivers/platform/x86/ is a good place to stash all x86 platform quirks.

I agree that tying this up with I2C bus notifier might not be the best
solution overall (it was simply available tight at this time) and we
could look into hooking this up into ACPI device enumeration to supply
missing properties.

That is also should be fixed in -next. Because i2c_adapter structure is
big enough so that looking up client->name in adapter is not going to
blow up, nor will it likely to match, it was decided it could stay till
next merge window.

Thanks.
