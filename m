Sorry but I can't find your notes about errors in your previous emails.
This solution indeed is a little bit more complex than just adding the
bits in i2c-i801, but I don't really see the reason for an *adapter*
driver to instantiate specific *clients* depending on some DMI
matching.

It's a platform issue, so it should be solved at a platform level, not
at the i2c adapter level.

Plus the bus notifier solutions guarantees plain separation between the
elements and prevents any conflicts, with or without compile guards.

This will only fix the fact that you have 2 concurrent drivers on the
same resource (freefall), not the fact that the global design of having
2 drivers which do not cooperate is wrong.

It's not a "fake i2c driver". It's a platform driver. If you don't like
the idea of the platform driver, just add the bus notifier code in
dell-smo8800, but this will pull a new dependency on I2C in this ACPI
driver.
