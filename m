Yes and we are aware of the risk of having the linear alias present, but
have yet to find a suitable way to handle this.

The proposed mechanism was to use reserved-memory and memremap() the
region while it should be available in Linux, but while this would work
for some cases (e.g. memory regions for semi-static firmware executed by
co-processors) it doesn't handle the scenarios where the memory-need is
dynamic.

So suggestions are very welcome on how to better handle this.
