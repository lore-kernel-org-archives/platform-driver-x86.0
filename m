Ok.

We have some in hwmon, but they get by with using devm_regulator_get_optional()
for both dt and non-dt systems. Only problem with that is that it returns
-ENODEV if regulators are not configured, which by itself is weird/odd
(and there have been endless discussions about it).

Messy :-(. I don't have a better idea, unfortunately.

More messy. Again, I don't have a better idea, but it is really weird that we
need all this code. There should really be some generic code handling all those
differences.

This will be stuck in returning -EPROBE_DEFER if the regulator subsystem
is disabled. Is this acceptable ?
