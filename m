Darren, it it truth that some laptops does not send keypress=20
event when Fn+wifi key is pressed (but only send ACPI event),=20
then really Alex's patch for input device is needed. But it could=20
be integrated into my driver. Also Alex wrote something about=20
ACPI events for laptops which have wifi key instead HW switch. So=20
before including this patch into tree, I would like to hear what=20
is problem with my patch for laptops which have wifi key...
