I mean that they may run the current driver on newer hardware that isn't 
in the DMI table, and that may be the only thing preventing it from 
working.

It's preferable to have the driver be able to support future hardware 
built to the same spec without having to add extra IDs. It's easy to 
make sure that you're loading on an IBM server - are there any of these 
that have the _RTL_ header but will break?
