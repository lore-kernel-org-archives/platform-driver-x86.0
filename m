Ugh. Ok, so that worked just because any error seem to re-trigger an
attempt to load the module later on my system (three times, it seems),
and most of the reproductions I had happened to work out on the second
load.

Looks like keeping the module loaded and adding a bus notifier to wait
for the right busses to show up is the only way to do this in a
foolproof way. Revised patch tonight or tomorrow.
