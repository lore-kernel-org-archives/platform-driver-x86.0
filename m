pci_disable_device() doesn't turn off the device; it only disables bus
mastering (and some of the arch-specific pcibios_disable_device()
implementations do a little more).  But it's certainly the wrong
direction -- it disables DMA, which has nothing to do with the BAR
decoding we're interested in.

What if the driver did something like this:

  pci_disable_decoding(dev, IORESOURCE_MEM);
  pci_release_resource(dev, 2);
  pci_resize_bar(dev, bar, size);
  pci_assign_resources(dev);
  pci_enable_decoding(dev, IORESOURCE_MEM);

That would require adding pci_enable/disable_decoding() to the driver
API, along with the requirement that the driver discard and remap
some resources after pci_enable_decoding().  I think
pci_enable_decoding() would look much like the existing
pci_enable_resources() except taking a resource type instead of a
bitmask.

I would *prefer* if we released and reassigned all resources, because
then the core has complete flexibility to move things around, and it's
easy to document that pci_assign_resources() means you have to
reread/remap everything.

If the driver only releases specified BARs, the pci_assign_resources()
interface becomes "you need to reread/remap the BAR you resized, plus
any other BARs you released".  It's a little more complicated to
describe and more dependent on previous driver actions.

But releasing only the specified BAR will make your life easier and
help with the fact that multiple drivers might be using the same BAR
(I have to raise my eyebrows at that), so I think I'm OK with it.  And
it would also side-step the "can't restore previous state" problem.

It's an "interesting" asymmetry that pci_enable_device() turns on BAR
decoding but doesn't touch bus mastering, while pci_disable_device()
turns off bus mastering but doesn't touch BAR decoding.
