Well we don't suppress driver unbinding via sysfs here, unless I
missed something, so the leak could be triggered that way.

I mean:

 lookup = clkdev_hw_create(data->clks[3].hw, "mclk", NULL);

and then freeing that lookup with clkdev_drop in the remove of
the driver. "mclk" is really generic for a connection name
without an associated device id, so you may want to pass some
device as the last argument here, but dev_name(&pdev->dev) seems
odd because that's the clock controller device, not whatever
device would be calling clk_get() with this created lookup in
mind.
