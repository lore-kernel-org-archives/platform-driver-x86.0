It does, but the audio controller only shows under SG disabled.

This is how the Nvidia variant works:

When SG is enabled:
One audio controller, the integrated one.
All sounds comes from the integrated one, including DP/HDMI.

When SG is disabled:
Two audio controller.
The DP/HDMI sounds come from the Nvidia audio controller. Others are from  
the integrated audio controller.

The system in the bug doesn't have "Switchable Graphics".

Right now all sounds output are from integrated audio controller on SG  
enabled machines.

Thanks for the info, I'll also put Nvidia vendor ID on next patch version.
