Another idea:

What about passing struct calling_interface_buffer from caller allocate=
d
memory (either from stack or kernel alloc) to dell-smbios which will
copy it into own buffer under 4GB and then pass it to dcdbas?

This will avoid to use that get/release function and there will be only
one send_request.

But I will let decision for API to other people as I do not know what
the best API to use here...
