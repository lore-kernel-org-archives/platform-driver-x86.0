Apple laptops with hybrid graphics have a device named gmux that is used
for switching between GPUs and backlight control. On many models this is
the only reliable method for controlling the backlight.

This series adds initial support for the gmux device, along with
anciallary support for disabling apple_bl when the gmux device is
detected. Initially only backlight control is supported.

Changes since v3:

 - Rename apple_bl_register_count to apple_bl_registered and make it
   static.

 - Add stubs for apple_bl register/unregister functions and drop
   APPLE_GMUX's dependency on BACKLIGHT_APPLE.

Thanks,
Seth
