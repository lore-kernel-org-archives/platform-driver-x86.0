That's fine.  We are not talking about spreading the merge of a
patch-set over different releases, or even release candidates.  All
non-bugfix patches should be in by -rc1.

You cannot bisect a specific function back before it was merged.  It's
impossible.

P1 ---> P4 ---> P3 ---> P2
                         ^
Bisect only starts working here.  Prior to this point the feature
doesn't build at all.  If it builds, but breaks, then that is a build
dependency and is a different use-case to what we are discussing here.

If it is possible for a patch-set to break functionality, then again,
this is a dependency and needs to be handled differently.

That is not the case with your set.

You wouldn't use bisect for that use-case.  We only use bisect for
features that have a working commit in Mainline.  The use-case you
mention would be pretty trivial to debug without bisect.

When we tout "history must be bisectable", we mean that it must remain
possible to bisect existing functionality.  Bisecting functionality
which is yet to fully land upstream is foolish.

New drivers almost never (if ever) go in as a fully working piece.
The registration parts (DT, Platform, etc) go in via one (or several)
tree(s) and the driver parts are normally split up into subsystems and
go in via their own repos.  If there are *build*, *API* or *merge*
time dependencies, then we can use immutable branches and merge via
a single tree.  Failing that, we split them.
