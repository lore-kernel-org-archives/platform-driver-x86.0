And I assume you are not going to do that. Isn't acpica code outside
of the scope of Linux kernel development? If not, how do I go about
adding that capability.

Also, I find it weird that this the first driver that needs this.

Finally, I'm much more interested on what happens next, because I want
to link this driver to the thermal framework, so when temperature gets
too high, the fan gets an increased speed, because right now it seems
it's always on low speed, temperature gets high, and instead the CPU
gets throttled, which is not desirable.

Maybe this driver should be added to the staging area.
