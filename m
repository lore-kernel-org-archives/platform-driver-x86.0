Multiple reasons:

1) Multi-boot with windows without needing to toggle a BIOS option all the time
2) Many of these devices only ship with windows, the Android option is there
from the BIOS template code they used, but is untested, so this may give us
the 3 separate devices but at the same time break other stuff
3) On some devices the BIOS tries to autodetect the OS, overriding the BIOS option
4) On some devices, including the one I'm developing on, but I can "fix" this with
a BIOS downgrade, this option has been locked to avoid 2.
5) Users really should not need to touch BIOS settings ever

My main goal for Linux on Bay Trail / Cherrytrail devices is for everything to
just work independent of the OSID setting and I'm afraid that this is also
necessary to properly support al variants of hw out there. E.g. My cube iwork8
air does 3. from the above list, so if I do:

touch /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI
reboot

OSID = 1 (BIOS thinks it is running Windows 8.1 / 10)

And if I then do:

rm /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI
reboot

OSID = 4 (BIOS thinks it is running Android)

Independent of the option I select in the BIOS.

Also I would like to point out that the entire pseudo-driver including
copyright header is only 144 lines, so it is not like we need a crazy
amount of code to deal with this.

Hans
