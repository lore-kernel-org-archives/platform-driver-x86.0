My biggest concern is fragmentation after the boards start to ship. I
recognize this comes under the "lack of planning on your part doesn't
constitute an emergency on my part" heading (although it really wasn't
a lack of planning). Now that this is out here and people can see where
it's going, if we choose to nack these and wait for a better
implementation, that alone may accomplish the same goal.

Currently the linux-yocto_3.8 standard/minnow Linux kernel is the only
thing known to boot on it. This is what will ship with the device.

What are you referring to with "programming model" here?

The three drivers in question:
minnowboard.c
minnowboard-gpio.c
minnowboard-keys.c

are all board-specific. They map GPIO to their fixed functions and
provide an API for board-specific queries (minnowboard.c), they provide
example uses (minnowboard-gpio and minnowboard-keys) which aid in
experimentation and the development of new drivers.

Which of these make sense as ACPI devices in your opinion?
