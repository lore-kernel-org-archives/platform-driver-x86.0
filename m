I have a EEEpc 1005PE. I'm looking at the backlight problem on this
machine, but it seems to be different from this one.

The hotkey seems to work perfectly when ACPI video driver is loaded.
i.e. I get a single hotkey event when pressing the hotkey and the value
of /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness changes correctly.

The only problem I get is that the actual brightness does not change
consistently.
say, there are 15 brightness levels in all,
level 0, level 5 and level 12 give me a screen with lowest brightness.
If I want to get maximum backlight, I need to set it to level 4 or level
11.

could you tell me your BIOS version please?

thanks,
rui
