Hi,

How to fix or debug the $subject? You always have to press Fn+F2 to hard 
unblock the rfkill after every boot on a local brand laptop.

If the rfkill switch is really a switch which can be toggled on/off, 
this makes sense. If you keep it Off, it will come as blocked. But it 
seems that on this machine Fn+F2 controls the hard block state.

It should either be saved in somewhere (I've read that there is a 
persistent knob for rfkill drivers in sysfs which tells whether the 
state is kept in a non-volatile space across boots or not) or all soft 
and this kind of Fn+Fx hard blocks should be explicitly disabled by 
kernel during boots.

I don't have direct access to the machine but the owner will help if you 
need any output, etc.

After booting:

0: hci0: Bluetooth
         Soft blocked: no
         Hard blocked: no
1: phy0: Wireless LAN
         Soft blocked: no
         Hard blocked: yes

After pressing Fn+F2:
0: phy0: Wireless LAN
         Soft blocked: no
         Hard blocked: no
1: hci0: Bluetooth
         Soft blocked: no
         Hard blocked: no
