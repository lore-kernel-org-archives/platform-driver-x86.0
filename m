In case it makes sense, trigger can implement that POLLPRI event. E.g.
for CPU trigger it probably does not make sense (or at least send
POLLPRI event lot of times per second).

Yes, how triggers interact with brightness file, what happen when you
write 0 on active trigger, what happen when you read brightness file
with active trigger / without trigger.
