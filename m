Yes, this is right behavior.

Because have a acer-wmi patch in 2.6.38 to sync the connection devices
(wlan, bluetooth, 3G) status with BIOS.
Acer BIOS fills-in the device initial states in SMBIOS when system boot=
,
then acer-wmi dirver sync this states with killswitch. By default, Acer
BIOS set the bluetooth to off.

Yes, this is also right behavior, because acer-wmi driver will maintain
the killswitch status with BIOS.

About 2. - 3.
I thought the above behavior causes by rfkill-input reverse the hci0's
killswitch when you pressed HW bluetooth, the HW bluetooth send out a
KEY_BLUETHOOTH keycode then rfkill-input capture it to do hci0's status
reverse.
I suggest leave userland application to do killswitch, don't use
rfkill-input.

You can do:
	- Use rfkill unblock acer-bluetooth SW killswitch, don't use HW blueto=
oth switch.
	- If you still want to use HW bluetooth switch, then I suggest disable=
 your rfkill-input.
	  Have 2 way:
		+ Use urfkill daemon: http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/urfkil=
l
		  This is a userland daemon can lock the rfkill-input to disable it t=
emporarily.
		+ Direct set CONFIG_RFKILL_INPUT=3DN in kernel, but you will need to =
rebuild kernel.
		  After set rfkill-input disable, you need control killswitch from us=
erland.
		  You can control it by rfkill tool or also try urfkill daemon.

We are adding more feature in urfkill daemon, I and Gary's plan is use =
urfkill daemon to replace
the rfkill-input in kernel.

>=20

Yes, rfkill default_state doesn't help, because acer-wmi driver will
sync the devices status from BIOS, it's right behavior.

hciconfig=20

>=20

Yes, that because acer-wmi didn't sync the bluetooth status with BIOS
when system boot in 2.6.37 kernel.
