Hi Marc,

sorry for the silence, I was overly busy with a state exam on Japanese
and some presentations.

TT I meant. But patching the kernel and running your module I see at least
that there is support for battery_care_limiter and some others.
On my VGN-Z11 I get:
battery_care_limiter  lid_resume_control  subsystem@	    uevent
bluetoothpower	      modalias		  thermal_control   wwanpower
driver@		      odd_power		  thermal_profiles
fanspeed	      power/		  touchpad
in /sys/devices/platform/sony-laptop.

What I am missing is the shock protector, there is a sensor built in.

How can I check that?

Currently we are not evaluating HSC0 at all, I am not sure about its
function. only HSC1 is used to query the speed/stamina switch.
Furthermore, the path of HSC1 is different on different modules
	_SB.PCI0.LPC.SNC.HSC1	(VGN)
and
	_SB.PCI0.LPCB.SNC.HSC1	(VPC)


Not much more is used actually, but turning on/off the nvidia (secondary
gpu) and the speed/stamina led by hooking into
	_SB.PCI0.OVGA._DSM (VGN)
and
	_SB.PCI0.P0P2.DGPU._DSM (VPC)
with various function indices (2 -> led, 3 -> gpu off).

> What does handle 0x0128 aim to provide?

No idea..

If anything what I said makes sense to you and you need more information,
please let me know. I can hack the module code and dump acpi etc
whatever might be useful for you.

Best wishes

Norbert
