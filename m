Jean makes a good point. I would insist on this if the Kconfig default was y or
if distros were likely to enable this by default. However, this is for the still
very rare x86 tablet and is likely to only be enabled for those systems which
require it.

To emphasize its role, perhaps this driver should have a depends on TOUCHSCREEN_SILEAD?

While the default for Kconfig is n if not explicitly set to m or y, perhaps
"default n" should be added to TOUCHSCREEN_SILEAD and SILEAD_DMI to make it more
explicit. I don't know if there is an official preference on "default n"
statements or not.
