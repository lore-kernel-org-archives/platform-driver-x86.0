Just had another look at this: Shouldn't the EAGAIN here be
EPROBE_DEFER?

The reasoning is that we would want to defer probing of the driver if we
can't get any GPIO pins, since we know that MSHW0040 should have some.
It has in the past been reported that the driver didn't load properly
(without this check), since it could happen that the GPIO subsystem
wasn't quite ready yet when probing.

Best,
Maximilian
