Gaming mostly (supertuxkart anyone?), but some others (including myself)
want to use it as a movement detection (one exists for the IBM/Lenovo
Thinkpads).

Digging into platform drivers, I've found that the hdaps and also the lis3lv02d
drivers report the axes via polldev, and since I don't want to break userspace,
I'm left with two choices:

1 - Keep sysfs entry and adapt it to properly report direction, and no
polled device.

2 - Keep sysfs entry and adapt it to properly report direction, and also
a polled device.

Let me know your decision so I can send an updated patch.
