From source code (at 549b4930f057) it looks like dell_set_arguments() which

Turns out that the problem has already surfaced before, but from a different 
origin -- namely, rfkill interface [1]. This was subsequently fixed in 
5246741a3f2e and c6f9288ee460.

This time there is an ordering problem between initialization of the 
dell-laptop module and audio modules which are trying to flash a microphone 
mute led on keyboard (via dell-laptop interface).

And about suspend-to-ram wakeup problem -- is it possible that there was some 
buggy interaction with smbios that led to the observed behaviour?
