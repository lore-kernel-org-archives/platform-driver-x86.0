ABI is documented in arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/sgx.h that from which the
documentation is included to intel_sgx.rst. I'm not saying that there is
no space refine it but it is neither undocumented.

I do have the in-kernel launch enclave stuff backed up here:

https://github.com/jsakkine-intel/sgx-le-host
https://github.com/jsakkine-intel/sgx-le

This is about as simple as it gets without any type of run-time.
