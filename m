Yes, that would work. I've sent already keymap to linux-hotplug mailing=
 list=20
(with a note to update the meanings to be in-line with other keymaps):

0xD9 bluetooth # (toggle) off-to-on                                    =
                                             =20
0xF1 touchpad_on # (toggle) off-to-on                                  =
                                             =20
0xF2 touchpad_off # (toggle) on-to-off                                 =
                                             =20
0xF9 connect # Sync                                                    =
                                             =20
0xEE screenlock # Lock                                                 =
                                             =20

My keymap problem was caused by started `hald`, which reset the keymap =
to some=20
bad one. I've removed hald from startup and the keys are mapped well no=
w. Also=20
the starting of bluetooth with BT HW button works as expected now.

Thanks, not necessary.
