MM? What does it stand for?

This last one is interesting because, from the other DSTDs I have seen, 
I suspect your notebook to have handle 0x0113, an handle that allows to 
enable/disable an unknown feature, is it the HDD protection?

This is interesting too. Ok, let's not speak about the multiplexer 
methods, let us speak about handle 0x0128, related to the Hybrid GFX 
feature. I have never done a deep analysis, maybe you can help here.
First of all, newer VPCZ1 models come with a few more methods, dealing 
with the screen brightness level, HSC5, HSC6, HSC7. Then:
- HSC0 returns the event reason (1 switch position change? what about 
2,3,4?)
- HSC1 returns some state bits (what about their meaning?)
- HSC2, HSC3, HSC4?

Moreover:

  Field (ECF2, ByteAcc, Lock, Preserve)
         {
                     Offset (0xF1),
             HPWR,   1, 			<-- ?
             HLMX,   1, 			<-- ?
             HCMM,   1, 			<-- ?
             DLED,   1, 			<-- discrete GFX led
             ILED,   1, 			<-- integr. GFX led
             ALED,   1, 			<-- auto GFX led
                     Offset (0xF2),
             SWPS,   1, 			<-- ?
             HPOK,   1, 			<-- ?
             HHPD,   1, 			<-- HDMI related
             DHPD,   1, 			<-- DVI related
             ATSW,   1			<-- auto switching related
         }

What does handle 0x0128 aim to provide?
