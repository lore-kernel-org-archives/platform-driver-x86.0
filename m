Resend with fixes per comments: Driver for the ACPI interface to the
accelerometer on the Pegatron Lucid tablets (sold as WeTab and ExoPC).

I could pass the ACPI prefix (or a handle) through the platform driver
if you like, but it's a little more complexity and as you mention that
seems like overkill for a driver whose core is only three lines of
code.  Left unchanged.

Detection is done in asus-laptop: this code won't be reached unless
the platform device is created, which is after the three needed
methods have already been detected with acpi_check_handle().

Fixed.

Fixed in Makefile.  Kconfig is hopelessly out of order, but I did what
I could.

No love here; I was trying to adhere to what looked like existing
convention.  Removed.

True enough.  Fixed.

It's an attempt to avoid this from drivers/base/core.c:

      WARN(1, KERN_ERR "Device '%s' does not have a release() "
           "function, it is broken and must be fixed.\n",
           dev_name(dev));

...but it was in the wrong place.  The input device doesn't hit that
path, the platform device does.  Moved to where it belongs.
