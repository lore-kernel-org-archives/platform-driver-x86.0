It is neccessary, see the current discussion.

=20

current_brightness will only appear on machines and in situations,
where we, well, can report current brightness. When you read
"brightness" file, you don't know if you are getting current
brightness or not, and it can't be changed easily.

Please go through the discussion. This design was chosen for a reason.

Thanks,
