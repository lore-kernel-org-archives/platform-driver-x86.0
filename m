--- at this point, one commit before
9f09ac68e7af2001a24242cbe0f6e40e89dd6c62, the behaviour changes: the
computer does not reboot anymore, but it doesn't boot either. It hangs
with a backlit but black LCD. I let it alone for several minutes, it
didn't boot.
I double-checked by swapping twice between this kernel and the previous
one (9f09ac68e7af2001a24242cbe0f6e40e89dd6c62), falling back to the
2.6.35.6 compiled in late September 2010 to get the computer to boot and
swap kernels.

    Xen: fix typo in previous patch

    Correctly name the irq_chip structure to fix an immediate failure
when booting
    as a xen pv_ops guest with a NULL pointer exception. The missing 'x' was
    introduced in commit [fb412a178502dc498430723b082a932f797e4763]
applied to
    2.6.3[25]-stable trees.  The commit to mainline was
    [aaca49642b92c8a57d3ca5029a5a94019c7af69f] which did not have the
problem.

But none of that makes any sense for multiple reasons...
I guess it's time for me to:
* try recompiling older kernel versions that I previously successfully
compiled to a kernel in proper booting state. But the package
installation history in Synaptic between September 27th 2010 (last
working kernel so far) and November 23th 2010 (first bad kernel) doesn't
show any upgrade of binutils or gcc...
* try out other kernel series: 2.6.32, 2.6.34, 2.6.37 and the 2.6.38-rc
series.


Sorry for the noise...


Regards,
Lionel.
