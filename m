I think that is great that libinput has tried solving this for the
tablet mode, but unfortunately libinput only works for users of
libinput, leaving cases such as:

1. In-kernel input handlers, such as SysRq, VT and others
2. Systems that do not rely on libinput for userspace handing (Android,
Chrome OS)
3. Systems with policies that are more complex than tablet mode only.

Because of libinput's inability to affect the kernel, and the presence
of "always on" input handlers (sysrq, VT keyboard, potentially others),
while libinput may control whether consumers receive events from certain
input devices, it will not allow power savings that an explicit
"inhibit" allows when coming from dedicated power policy manager.

I think pushing policy decisions into a library, and trying to have all
clients agree with it, is much harder and leaks unnecessary knowledge
into quite a few layers. A dedicated power policy manager, that is not
only responsible for input device, but power state of the system as a
whole, is a very viable architecture.

The inhibiting of the events works for 100% of input devices, the power
savings work for the ones that implement it. It is responsibility of
folds shipping the systems to make sure drivers they use support inhibit
if they believe it will help their battery life.

This is a good point. We should look into signalling that some events
have been dropped (via EV_SYN/SYN_DROPPED) so that clients are aware of
it.

I believe majority will simply reuse open/close callbacks. In Chrome OS
we have dedicated inhibit/uninhibit, but I would like to allow using
open/close as alternatives.

This is not evdev interface, it is at the level above evdev (so that it
can affect all handlers, not only evdev). As such it is not bound by
evdev interface.

Thanks.
