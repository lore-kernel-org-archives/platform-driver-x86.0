Yeah, true - I probably should have prodded on that more at the time.

In general, I'm much more comfortable presenting parsed and formatted data
through sysfs than I am dumping ACPI buffer objects out there wholesale.

So we have:
  guid
  instance_count
  expensive
  notify_id
  object_id
  setable

Hrm. Is there something more we need that isn't already present here?

Need to look more closely if all the values for the Flags are covered, but
otherwise we seem to have already parsed and presented all the relevant content
in the wdg.

Pali, how does the "magic number identifier" in the BMOF map to the object_id?
Have we retained that information in what we export today?
