I've recently noticed another problem with using acpi_video_unregister()
to disable known broken backlights -- another module might call
acpi_video_register() and make it reappear. i915 does this, so when I
EFI boot the MacBook Pro 8,2 the acpi backlights reappear (under a BIOS
compatible boot the Intel GPU doesn't show up on the bus).

So Corentin's solution does seem like a better way to go, or else
something similar that forces the ACPI video driver to behave as with
acpi_video=vendor.
