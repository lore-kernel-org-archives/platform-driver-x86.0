Hi everyone,

I need to detect the presence of apple-gmux (ACPI HID "APP000B")
in several DRM drivers to handle backlight, runtime pm and
deferred probing properly.

There's an idiom in use by 7 other drivers to detect presence of
a particular ACPI HID which involves calling acpi_get_devices()
and passing it a minimal callback that does no further filtering.
However this approach results in lots of duplicate code.

This series adds acpi_dev_present(), the ACPI equivalent to
pci_dev_present(). It takes a HID string and returns a bool,
allowing us to simplify the drivers considerably by removing
all the duplicate callbacks and other boilerplate.

I've pushed these patches to GitHub to ease reviewing:
https://github.com/l1k/linux/commits/acpi_dev_present

Should this series find acceptance, it would probably be best if
we could agree to merge everything through a single repository,
e.g. acpi (git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm).
or alternatively alsa (which contains 5 of the 7 drivers involved).
Consequently I would like to invite the driver maintainers to
kindly provide acks (or raise objections, if any).

The series should not result in any functional changes, however
I lack the hardware to actually verify this for every driver
involved. I did test it with apple-gmux though.

Thanks,

Lukas
