Thanks for the info. The firmware has a _OSI("Windows 2012") query so
should be covered by my patch.

Yes, that's all.

Yes, that's right.

For systems with Intel i915 GPU, ACPI video will wait for GPU driver to
run first, see drivers/acpi/video.c acpi_video_init, the actual
acpi_video_register function is called by i915 driver in
i915_driver_load due to operation region related stuff. Since all
problematic systems reported so far has an Intel GPU, I'm doing it this
way now. If things change, we can enhance it then.
