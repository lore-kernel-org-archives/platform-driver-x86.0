Unfortunatly, it would break udev (well.. only the touchpad key, which
probably never worked, does it really matters ?) ...

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/hotplug/udev.git;a=blobdiff;f=extras/keymap/95-keymap.rules;h=9059a8c41e4505f0d8088a90fc0c3a64fe8d5f2d;hp=053838d803d7142dd80fbca361ef65565c6189f2;hb=0d8b6be5f5238360d2d8e220d6da280f842c5358;hpb=e99cc72398d1d5057cc6d1e4c065799f8daaf29e

But your probably right for rfkill and hotplug slot name.

Yep .. but as this led probably never worked before the last patchset,
this is probably not the most important string to keep. And users
tends to use only the second part of the led name (*::touchpad,
*::kbd_backlight, etc...).

Ok, I'll try to do something like that.

asus-wmi.ko - generic stuff
asus-nb-wmi.ko - used only on notebooks (bweark, asus-nb-wmi is an
horrible name :/)
eeepc-wmi.ko  - used only on eeepcs

And you'll be able to register only one asus_wmi_driver at a time,
since asus-wmi will have some static stuff in it (hotplug_slot_ops,
device_attribute, attribute, attribute_group, dev_pm_ops).
