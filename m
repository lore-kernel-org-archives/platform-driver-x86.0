I did use thos options. I used the following command:

git format-patch -M -C --notes -v12 -o ~/patches/. @^^^^

I really don't know what you are targeting. :)

checkpatch.pl complains if there are NOT empty lines between
declarations and statements.

I missed that one. Bummer.

I mean, it's not game-breaking, its just minor style stuff. I won't be
sending more revisions because of these small issues, as I think its 
uneccessary to flood both Rafael and the mailing lists with patch
revisions that remove or add a few spaces. No offence, it just got old.

It could, but it does not. :)

See above about the checkpatch.pl stuff.

Got it.

One could add a hook for other various reasons, not just to add or
remove sysfs attributes. I'm talking stuff like desktop notifications or
notifications to other modules to change power modes or other stuff.
