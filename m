ACK.
I'll remove these names and resend.  Thanks.

RFC.
If we do not add ignore_loglevel to the command line, the acpi earlycon will be mute just as what you want.
Do you really want this to be:
#undef DEBUG
If we do this, all pr_debug invocations in this file will be empty in compilation stage and are there any other means for us to view the output of ACPI earlycon without recompiling?

ACK.
I'll do the modification.

NAK.
I think this variable will be read only once and written up to 16 times so __read_mostly is not required.
I'll check and add __init and __initdata for this patch.

ACK.
It's my mistake.  The size of the bitmap should be "MAX_ACPI_DBG_PORTS<<1 or MAX_ACPI_DBG_PORTS*2".
The reason is:
I think MAX_ACPI_DBG_PORTS=4 is enough in this case.
Since the systems running Linux are 32/64 bit architectures, using 2 bitmaps will be waste.
As the systems are at least 32 bit, the MAX_ACPI_DB_PORTS is defined as 16 to make full use of the bitmap.

NAK.
This is to support "MULTIPLE DBG2 debug ports".

** MULTIPLE DBGP table versions and MULTIPLE DBG2 debug ports support **
The whole patch takes ENODEV as the semantics of "table not exist or table version not supported" in PROBE/START stage so that we can obtain the ability of probing Microsoft's future tables in the order from DBGn, ..., DBG2, DBGP.
We should not return here as users may pass the following command line:
earlyprintk=acpi2,keep
to let the first 2 debug ports mute, but take the 3rd as a Linux earlycon.

ACK.
I'll try to implement this within 80 characters.

ACK.
It's my mistake, the previous version uses port_index=1 as the first debug port, but this version takes 0 as the first port.

NAK.
See " MULTIPLE DBGP tables and MULTIPLE DBG2 debug ports support" above.

> how about 'return acpi_early_console_start(..)'

NAK.
See " MULTIPLE DBGP tables and MULTIPLE DBG2 debug ports support" above.

RFC.
This is to support "MULTIPLE DBGP table versions".
