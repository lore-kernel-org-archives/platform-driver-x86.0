That's what I was trying to do in  [PATCH v2] platform/x86: asus-wmi: Add
keyboard backlight toggle support. However, that brought another problem
discussed in the thread.
https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=152639169210655&w=2

So I moved the brightness change in the driver without passing to userspace.
Per Hans, seems there're some other concerns and I also wonder if the
TOGGLE event happens in ASUS HID (asus-hid.c) which also convert and
pass the keycode to userspace but no TOGGLE key support yet What should
we do then?
