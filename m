You mean reset to Intel default? I think we can also just reset the cached MSR values on each power cycle, which would be simpler, IMHO?

I think we definitely need some code to handle S3-S5, but should be in separate patches, since I think the major impact of S3-S5 is entire EPC being destroyed. I think keeping pm_cnt is not sufficient enough to handle such case?

IMO VM just gets "sudden loss of EPC" after suspend & resume in host. SGX driver and SDK should be able to handle "sudden loss of EPC", ie, co-working together to re-establish the missing enclaves.

Actually supporting "sudden loss of EPC" is a requirement to support live migration of VM w/ SGX. Internally long time ago we had a discussion and the decision was we should support SGX live migration given two facts:

1) losing platform-dependent is not important. For example, losing sealing key is not a problem, as we could get secrets provisioned again from remote. 2) Both windows & linux driver commit to support "sudden loss of EPC".

I don't think we have to support in very first upstream driver, but I think we need to support someday.

Sean, 

Would you be able to comment here?

IMHO this is not required, as I mentioned above.
