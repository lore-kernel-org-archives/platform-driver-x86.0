Random errors can also just happen, so if you're concerned about that
you might want to build each object on two different machines and
compare. Good luck generating the *same* random errors on two machines.

(And, of course, someone can also DoS you in any number of other ways,
such as accepting data and then never sending back a result. So you'll
need timeouts and failovers.)

I've seen some approaches for that, but you could also just statically
link your compiler. (Since you'd need attestation for all the individual
libraries, you'd need to know the versions of all those libraries, so
you might as well just statically link.)

Memory management doesn't seem that hard to deal with.
