I agree, notification for changes done by kernel triggers and blinking
is bad idea!

I mean only notification when somebody write directly to brightness
sysfs attribute.

It is possible that there will be more daemons doing this thing. And on
linux it is supported to have more alternative softwares which do
similar/same thing...

And once some application will need event that keyboard backlight was
changed (e.g. it will show something on screen, etc), then such
application must implement interface of any such daemon. It is easier
for such application to open sysfs file and listen for POLL_PRI.

Still this can be useful in scenario when only one "keyboard backlight
daemon" is installed and running in system. In some cases for users or
scripts is easier to change level directly by writing value into sysfs
entry. I can imagine that this is what some "universal" power management
scripts will do. For bash scripts it is easier to write some value into
/sys as clicking on some desktop GUI slider or calling some complex dbus
function... And I prefer that echo something > /sys/... too.

Probably running more "keyboard backlight daemons" is not what people
start doing, but having more applications which write value into /sys is
not very rare.

And I think that if "running more keyboard backlight daemons" is not
supported by current version of kernel, then kernel should not allow
such situation... It will be hard to debug such thing if happen.

Agree.
