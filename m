What GPUs are there in your MBP11,3? From your dmesg it looks like all
you have is NVIDIA GPU 0000:01:00.0 (lspci?).

Is there a somehow hidden intel GPU around doing the backlight?
If so my locking does the wrong thing for your system as:

[    0.393298] vgaarb: device added: PCI:0000:01:00.0,decodes=io+mem,owns=none,locks=none
[    0.393299] vgaarb: loaded
[    0.393300] vgaarb: setting as boot device: PCI:0000:01:00.0
[    0.393301] vgaarb: bridge control possible 0000:01:00.0
...
[   13.693379] apple_gmux: Found gmux version 4.0.8 [indexed]
[   13.693400] vgaarb: device changed decodes: PCI:0000:01:00.0,olddecodes=io+mem,decodes=io+mem:owns=none
[   13.693404] apple_gmux: locked IO for PCI:0000:01:00.0

Here it triggers "olddecodes=none -> io+mem".

Making sure to lock only the intel GPU when present and especially protecting
against nvidia driver will be hard if legacy-IO is being processed by a hidden
device!
