Would this be a class driver that would expose a chardev for each
bound GUID?  I agree that this makes a lot more sense than trying to
shoehorn it into sysfs.  Especially since we'd want closing the
chardev to disable any "expensive" collections that have been enabled
by ioctl on that chardev.  Exposing Dell's smbios entry point through
this type of device seems reasonable to me.

If we go this route, then I think that exposing the MOF through sysfs
would make sense -- after all, someone might actually want to parse
the thing for production purposes.

On a sort-of-on-topic note, there's one platform feature that we
complete fail to handle in the kernel that might be nice to add before
it gets kludged into lots of userspace code: battery charge controls.
Thinkpads expose charge thresholds using abominable interfaces, but I
think they've all been reverse-engineered.  Dell probably has them,
and I bet that Mario would consider telling us how to use them if we
asked nicely.  It might be nice to expose these generically through
sysfs somewhere.

I'm guilty myself:
