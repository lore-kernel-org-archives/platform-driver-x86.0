How are spinlocks and mutexes getting into p2pdma ranges in the first
instance? Even with UC, the system has bigger problems if it's trying
to send bus locks targeting PCI, see the flurry of activity of trying
to trigger faults on split locks [1].

This does raise a question about separating the cacheability of the
'struct page' memmap from the BAR range. You get this for free if the
memmap is dynamically allocated from "System RAM", but perhaps
memremap_pages() should explicitly prevent altmap configurations that
try to place the map in PCI space?

That's reasonable, but it still seems to be making a broken
configuration marginally less broken. I'd be more interested in
safeguards that prevent p2pdma mappings from being used for any cpu
atomic cycles.
