Yeah that seems reasonable.

But that's also required to actually make the persistent state have any
impact at all.

So, I'm confused. Why does the driver not use the acer_wmi_notify
function to update the rfkill status too, but polls it every second?

Right -- I missed that part.

Hmm, that I don't understand. Why would that reproduce the issue? Ah,
ok, that's because __rfkill_switch_all() will set global_states, and it
happens during init. So it gets registered with the global state, which
is still blocked since you just unblocked this single thing.

So, it seems that the design here only works if
 a) the bios stores the last state
 b) the driver only reports key inputs, no rfkill inputs

Yeah that's because the BT hw key seems to generate the wrong event?

Well I don't think we want to remove rfkill input, ever, because that
just leads to a mess where the user has to take action. I'd rather have
it work out of the box and be overridden by urfkill which should work
fine.

Of course, in this particular instance it _doesn't_ work out of the box=
,
but shouldn't we rather fix that?



But due the the behaviour you outlined earlier, I think your patch make=
s
sense... the BIOS doesn't actually seem to _store_ the rfkill state
anyway, since it's always off when you cold boot. So why bother using
that state as the default anyway?

That will work around the problem at hand by making the acer wmi enable
BT whenever it is loaded, but that doesn't seem so bad either.

As for the more generic problem, I'm not sure what to do. I really wish
people would just use urfkill.
