I don't think this is a good idea. It's still a property of the I2C
device, not the driver. It's crappy under Windows, but that doesn't
prevent us to do the right thing.

I think the idea of having it at the i2c_board_info level is the good
one. It's a property of the device node and it wouldn't hurt me to have
a device tree property for that too (not entering the DT field now).
There is no ACPI prop for it too, but I wouldn't be surprised if it
comes in a later revision. The advantage of having it turned on
unconditionally is that we can instantiate it from userspace without
breaking the sysfs ABI.

Note that in the 2 uses I have seen so far of Host Notify, in both cases
I need to instantiate the I2C device from an other driver (psmouse) so I
can control the content of i2c_board_info.

Cheers,
Benjamin
