It is a good idea to step back and let me explain what I wanted to
do here for userspace.

I have two kinds of applications that might use this driver.
1. simple use case where user sets a power limit for a RAPL domain.
e.g. set graphics unit power limit to 7w
2. advanced use case where use can do fine tuning on top of simple
power limit,e.g. the dynamic response parameters of power control
logic, event notifications, etc.

For #1, this driver register with the abstract generic thermal layer
(/sys/class/thermal) and presents itself as a set of cooling devices
with a single knob per domain for power limits.
root@chromoly:/sys/class/thermal/cooling_device15# echo 7000 > cur_state 

For #2, to give userspace complete control of the RAPL interface, which
is not generic, I put them under the device private sysfs area.
root@chromoly:/sys/class/thermal/cooling_device15/device# echo 1000 > time_window1 

As you mentioned about using device tree vs. fs, and how kobject are
used for fs. I do have the need to go between a generic thermal sysfs
and the true device tree. This is the reason why I used kobjects and
link them between device tree and its thermal sysfs representation.

e.g. a RAPL package cooling device linked with its platform device
kobj. (device is linked with rapl_domains/package, the line is too long)

root@chromoly:/sys/class/thermal# ls -l cooling_device15/
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Apr  2 15:03 cur_state
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    0 Apr  2 21:28 device
-> ../../../platform/intel_rapl/rapl_domains/package
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Apr  2 15:03 max_state
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root    0 Apr  2 21:28 power
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    0 Apr  2 15:03 subsystem
-> ../../../../class/thermal
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Apr  2 15:03 type
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Apr  2 15:03 uevent

For userspace which is not satisfied with the simple use case of a
single knob for setting power limit, it can follow the link to find the
device tree entry. Then get access to the complete knobs, including
event notifications.

I wanted to use generic thermal fs in that it gives a simple
representation of the most usable feature of RAPL. Basically, RAPL
domains can be enumerated by thermal control apps just as ACPI fans or
processor cooling.
