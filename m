note that this isn't per-process state, userspace can get release events
after open() for keys it never got the press event for. Simple test:
type evtest<enter> and KEY_ENTER up is the first event you'll get.

But otherwise I agree with you that press/release should always be balanced
if input_dev_release_keys() is called on inhibit and with that autorepeat
snippet below. At least I couldn't come up with any combination of multiple
clients opening/closing/inhibiting that resulted in an unwanted release
event after uninhibit.

Cheers,
