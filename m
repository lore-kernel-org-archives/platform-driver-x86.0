Right. As Pali pointed out previously, if there is an existing class driver /
subsystem which supports this functionality we should use that.

I suppose one risk will be one GUID exposing both types of methods. Those which
are used by kernel drivers, and those which have no kernel support. Or worse,
methods which have multiple behaviors depending on their input arguments.
