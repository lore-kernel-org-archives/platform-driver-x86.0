Ilpo and Sakari,

Thank you very much! It's very good to see an actual review after all this time!
Well it has been 3-4 months but feels a very long time.

The first version of this was posted in the lkml in 2024 and after that only sashiko-bot
provided more inputs so I followed that, perhaps too much.

It's very good to see humans!

Yeah... When I picked up Luke's work I took a lot of time (months) to modernize
the source as much as possible, then sashiko-bot found problem and either me or glm
fixed something, both of us reflecting how we woke up that morning, plus back and forth
with issues and things changed one way and back when I realized the approach was
going nowhere... And code that worked that was later changed leaving it suboptimal...
Loads of changes from both humans and LLMs (albeit the main culprit is me hahahah).

The xgm code was put together in two days from captures I ran in windows while
also fixing the MSI claw...

I'm not surprised this is a mixed bag. Oh well, I'm going to clean it up and make it very cool...
And I am already having ideas on how to replace the complex probe machinery that prevents
rogue devices with something more readable (and hopefully less long, because more than
5k lines of dense hid code is by far the longest modification I have ever attempted to linux).

I will take some days to properly review this and address comments over time!
Thank you very much again!

Best regards,
Denis Benato
