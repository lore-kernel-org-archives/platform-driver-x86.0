I don't have access to the laptop anymore, but from memory:

I tried wl, brcm80211 (from 2.6.38) and brcmsmac (from 2.6.39).  I
don't think b43 supported that hardware.

wl and brcmsmac both showed ideapad-laptop soft and hard unblocked and
the wireless driver's rfkill soft unblocked but hard blocked.

brcm80211 froze the system hard.  I think it can't deal with rfkill.

I tried that and it didn't help.  I even tried turning the switch on
and leaving the battery out for awhile.
