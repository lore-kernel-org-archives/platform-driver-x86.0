Of course the enclave could be simplified considerably since now it has
full code for EINITTOKEN generation, which is probably an overkill for a
selftest.

It could be simple as just enter and return to and from enclave or
something in-between in terms of complexity.

Even for the simplest enclave you need a signing tool (see sgxsign.c in
my sgx-le repository), a custom linker script and a sophisticated
makefile.
