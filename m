Interesting. Maybe Johannes can comment on that part since I think he
wrote the code that interacts with kernel for the rfkill test cases.

These specific failures were shown for the test cases in this file:
http://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/tree/tests/hwsim/test_rfkill.py

The interaction with kernel is done using this code:
http://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/tree/tests/hwsim/rfkill.py

It does indeed look like TYPE_ALL is used here (the block() and
unblock() implementations). If this is incorrect, we can certainly
change the script since I'd assume this is not used for anything else
than the hwsim test cases (or well who knows, it is available out there=
,
so if someone needs python code to do rfkill operations..).
