Yes, Linus today pulled that and it is in mainline now. From LED
subsystem point of view I don't see any problem - the file is called
brightness_hw_changed and its purpose is to report brightness changes
occurred in the hardware, outside of kernel control. It also returns
last brightness as was set by the hardware, which can be different from
what old brightness file reports in the same time.
