No difference.  Basically, there are two differences between suspend and
hibernation, as far as drivers are concerned:
(1) It's better to use the ->freeze()/->thaw() and ->poweroff()/->restore()
    callbacks for hibernation.
(2) It may be _much_ more difficult to get free memory during hibernation
    (so theoretically attempts to get memory during hibernation are more likely
    to block).

I'm not aware of any such changes.

Besides, the problem reported by Jeff seems to be caused by CPU hotplug.

Thanks,
