Hi,

It is interesting that the backlight buttons did not work for you. I
think your keyboard (0b05:1837)is a
USB_DEVICE_ID_ASUSTEK_ROG_KEYBOARD2.
I also have a ROG laptop (GL553VD) whose keyboard (0b05:1854) is being
identified as USB_DEVICE_ID_ASUSTEK_ROG_KEYBOARD1. Its keyboard
backlight shortcuts are enabled only after applying the following
patch. I am wondering why this harmless one liner did not find its way
into the modules tree. It's difficult to apply the patch to every keep
up with the latest. Maybe other ASUS people confirm this and help
pushing it further..
Kind Regards...
