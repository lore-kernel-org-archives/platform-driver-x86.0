Answer to myself, when debugfs is disabled, it's ok to give broken
dentry pointers to debugfs functions since they won't do anything.

Or better, something to check if a macro is defined in a particular con=
tact ?

But yeah, I found debugfs API disturbing, but it seems to be done like =
that to
ease the "debugfs is disabled case".
