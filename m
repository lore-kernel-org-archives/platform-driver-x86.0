Trying to figure out the mute status of all the inputs is not an option,
due to the extreme diversity of audio hardware.

Having the LED follow the mute status of the internal mic is doable, but
IMO, it severely limits the usability of the LED.

I still think the better solution would be to let userspace handle it,
but anyway, this question is not thinkpad-acpi specific. So maybe we
need to make it a /sys/class/led then for the time being - that would at
least be a uniform interface.

Well, a quick google search came up with this one [1]. But never mind -
this argument was just to show that the "mute status of all inputs" idea
is bad, and that's not happening anyway.
