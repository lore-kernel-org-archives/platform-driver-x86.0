=2D 0xcc/0xcd SW_TABLET mode seems to be consistent and widespread

=2D 0xc4-0xc7 KEY_VOLUME_{UP,DOWN} seems to be consistent, although not use=
d=20
very often (Lenovo Helix 2, XPS 12, other Dell XPS), others probably use WMI

=2D 0xc2/0xc3 KEY_LEFTMETA is used on Helix 2 and XPS 12, but only the XPS=
=20
issues 0xc2 on press and 0xc3 on release, the Helix 2 issues both codes on=
=20
release and none on press.

The statements above are verified on the XPS 12, the other findings are fro=
m=20
the Internet, search for "unknown event index" + "intel-vbtn".

As far as I can see, there are no implementation which do not issue the eve=
nts=20
in pairs, so currently the quirks table would be empty.

Kind regards,

Stefan
