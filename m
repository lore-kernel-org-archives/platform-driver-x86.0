Hi Andy,

I took a quick look at arch_setup_pdev_archdata(), overridden it in
dcdbas.c and it works well (despite it's being called twice, since
it's called from platform_device_alloc and platform_device_register).

However, as I am not super familiar with ELF weak method references,
especially with its scope resolution / versioning part, so as I see
this weak method was introduced mainly for arch/** specific hooks.
Is it safe to override this method from driver code, when let's say
there's another implementation in the x86 arch code (currently there
isn't)?

So while I agree that archdata should be ideally written from within
this hook to make sure the value is there when the bus notifiers call
the iommu code (currently not registered for platform_bus), I am just
a bit worried that this might mask a future generic arch
implementation and could cause issues. What do you think?

Best Regards,
Szabolcs
