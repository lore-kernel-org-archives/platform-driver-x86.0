Arg.. Sorry for that, I didn't realized that CONFIG_EFI=y was not
something rare these days.

I wonder how the windows driver works in this case.. Maybe they use
something completly different, and the SABI interface is still there
because nobody removed/disabled it ? In this case it's probably not a
good idea to use it on these machines since the implementation is
likely to be completly broken.
