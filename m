But if you use acpi-style errors won't be able to go back to the user (errno)
and userspace programs won't be able to display appropriate errors (on modprobe,
manipulating sysfs files, etc...). I didn't read the code, so it may
not be an issue here,
but you should check that meaningful error codes are sent back to userspace.
