So now you make it sound that devicetree is somehow really superior
to ACPI because it can actually be used to do some board-specific
configs, and ACPI tables are too hard to use?

Device tree was what we came up with for ARM go get *away* from
stashing custom config into the kernel, such as boardfiles and even
more horrible things like a command-line switch for every key.

Is x86 now not really presenting anything better? I would have a second
look at augmented ACPI tables, if that is what all of x86 is going to use.

FYI here is how I set up a heartbeat LED and some GPIO key in a
device tree:

        /* The user LED on the board is set up to be used for heartbeat */
        leds {
                compatible = "gpio-leds";
                user-led {
                        label = "user_led";
                        gpios = <&gpio0 2 0x1>;
                        default-state = "off";
                        linux,default-trigger = "heartbeat";
                };
        };

        /* User key mapped in as "escape" */
        gpio-keys {
                compatible = "gpio-keys";
                user-button {
                        label = "user_button";
                        gpios = <&gpio0 3 0x1>;
                        linux,code = <1>; /* KEY_ESC */
                        gpio-key,wakeup;
                };
        };
