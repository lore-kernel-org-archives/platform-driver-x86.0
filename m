Thanks for the pointer - I've given it a quick try and the driver loads
successfully, however, the event doesn't seem to be triggered. I've put
a printk into the eeepc_wmi_notify function, and this is seemingly neve=
r
called.. although I believe this may be the right direction, as the GUI=

from the eeepc driver (ABBC0F72-8EA1-11D1-00A0-C90629100000) and the on=

from my Lenovo (ABBC0F20-8EA1-11D1-00A0-C90629100000) differ only by a
single byte. Could this event be disabled somehow?=20

Corresponding to the 2nd GUID, there's also a WQIO method in my DSDT
which should return a data block, correct?
