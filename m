Both work. I've tested first CONFIG_RFKILL_INPUT disabled. Second I've =
tried to=20
enable CONFIG_RFKILL_INPUT, but remove the mentioned block of code. The=
 result=20
is working bluetooth HW switch.

`lshal -m` outputs this:

Strange is "brightness-up" key, somebody is wrong here.

Disabling CONFIG_RFKILL_INPUT works - see above. I had a look at Kconfi=
g in=20
net/rfkill and there is a line "default y if !EXPERT" which means (I th=
ink)=20
that it would be enabled by default for anybody not enabling expert opt=
ions.=20
So other non-expert users would have the same troubles as I have.

I've tried `rfkill unblock <acer-bluetooth number>` with my second test=
=20
(enabled CONFIG_RFKILL_INPUT plus patched core.c) - it works perfectly.

Anyway, it looks like using CONFIG_RFKILL_INPUT is broken to some degre=
e,=20
because enabling the config switch changes bluetooth HW/SW switch from =
working=20
to not-fully-working.
