Thanks for the input; a draft patch (which works fine on my system) is
attached below.

Hmmm. I do not yet understand why you propose to

a) advance the DCDBAS initialization to subsys_initcall, as only DELL_LAPTOP
   (running as a late_initcall) requires it to be up and running, and

b) delay DELL_WMI to late_initcall, as it can safely be initialized as long
   as ACPI_WMI is ready.

What do I miss?

Attached patch *seems* to work fine on my system.

Thanks,
	Dominik

Subject: [PATCH] platform/x86: dell-smbios: wait for WMI initialization

If DELL_SMBIOS_WMI is enabled, the combined dell-smbios driver
needs to wait for ACPI_WMI to be initialized, which occurs at the
subsys_initcall() level. As the dell-smbios driver only needs to
be up and running by the time the dell-laptop module is initialized,
which occurs at the late_initcall() level, it is sufficient to
initialize the dell-smbios driver at the default device_initcall()
level.
