This is still mostly a strawman, since userspace cannot have a database
of LEDs that indicate airplane mode.

I'm sure you'd also not like to see 2**7 triggers implemented in rfkill
to cover all the possibilities.

The "standard interface" is usable if you really just want to driver a
single LED and you know which one.

I think you're looking at this the wrong way, focusing too much on the
LED aspect.

Really what you have here is a concept of "airplane mode", and that
concept is specific to the rfkill subsystem. This happens to affect
mostly an LED trigger, today, but as a concept it's something that
*should* be managed within the rfkill subsystem.

That's simply unreasonable, you're essentially saying that any user of
any kernel infrastructure should be Cc'ed to the implementer of that
infrastructure... 9/10 patches in this series aren't even LED specific,
only the *previous* patch, the one that tied the "airplane mode"
concept to an LED trigger in a very standard way had anything to do
with LED triggers at all.
