I understood it as there would be explicit whitelist in kernel and new=20
GUIDs would be needed to add into whitelist, even those which do not=20
have kernel wmi driver.

Exporting all GUIDs (to userspace) which are not bind to kernel driver=20
has one big problem. If kernel introduce new wmi driver for such GUID=20
then it block userspace to access it or at least would need to provide=20
audit filter and something would be probably filtered. It means that=20
some userspace applications which would use that GUIDs stops working=20
after upgrading to new kernel. And we can be in situation where *user*=20
need to decide: either use 3rd party userspace application from vendor=20
which provide some special settings for your laptop, or use kernel=20
module which provides standard rfkill/led/input class driver.
