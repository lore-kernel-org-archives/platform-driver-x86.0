I think that Andy was talking about returning things like AE_ERROR,
which are of type acpi_status, as int.

You should return either the Linux error codes (in which case int is
the type to use) or ACPI error codes (in which the function should be
defined to return acpi_status).  Do not mix them.

Little-endian only though.  Don't do that unless your code is
guaranteed to always (now and in the future) run on little-endian.

Thanks,
