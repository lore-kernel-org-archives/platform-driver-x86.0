Some laptops can tune their keyboard backlight according to ambient
light sensors (auto mode). This capability is essentially a hardware
control trigger. Meanwhile, such laptops also offer a shrotcut for
cycling through brightness levels and auto mode. For example, on
ThinkBook, pressing Fn+Space ("shortcut") cycles keyboard backlight
levels in the following sequence:

  1 => 2 => 0 => auto => 1 ...

Recent ThinkPad models should have similar sequence too.

However, there are some issues preventing us from using a private
hardware control trigger:

1. We want a mechanism to tell userspace which trigger is the hardware
   control one, so that userspace can determine if auto mode is on/off,
   as well as turing it on/off programmatically without obtaining the
   trigger's name via other channels
2. Writing brightness has the side effect of disabling hardware control,
   but the hardware control trigger remains active, resulting in the
   software and hardware being out of sync. Most LED drivers that
   supports hardware control also suffer from the same issue
3. Turing on/off auto mode via the shortcut cannot activate/deactivate
   the corresponding hardware control trigger, making the software state
   out of sync
4. Even with #3 solved, deactivating the hardware control trigger has
   the side effect of emitting LED_OFF, breaking the shortcut cycle,
   especially "auto => 1"

This series tries to demonstrate a path on solving these issues:

- Introduce an attribute "trigger_may_offload", so that userspace can
  determine:
  - if the LED device supports hardware control (supported => visible)
  - which trigger is the hardware control trigger selected by the LED
    device
  - if the trigger is selected ("<foo_trigger>")
  - if the trigger is offloaded ("[foo_trigger]")
    - A callback offloaded() is added so that LED triggers can report
      their hardware control state
- Remove hardware control trigger when writing brightness
- Add led_trigger_notify_hw_control_changed() interface, so that LED
  drivers can notify the LED core about hardware-initiated hardware
  control transitions. The LED core will then determine if the
  transition is allowed and switching between "none" (i.e., no trigger)
  and the device's private trigger accordingly
  - This capability is restricted to the device's private trigger. If
    the current trigger is neither the private trigger nor "none", no
    transition will be made
  - This interface is gated behind Kconfig LEDS_TRIGGERS_HW_CHANGED and
    LED device flag LED_TRIG_HW_CHANGED
- Tune the logic of trigger deactivation so that it won't emit LED_OFF
  when the deactivation is triggered by hardware

The last three patches are included in the series to demonstrate how
these interfaces are supposed to be utilized, so that ideapad-laptop
can expose the auto mode of ThinkBook's keyboard backlight. They can be
submitted separately once the dust settles, if preferred.

The last patch in the series depends on commit 5029bff09e79
("platform/x86: ideapad-laptop: Fix driver unregistration order") from
platform-drivers-x86/for-next. 

[ Summary of other approaches ]

< custom attribute >

Pros:
- simplicity, KISS
- no need to touch the LED core
- extensible as long as it has a sensor-neutral name
  - a sensor-related name could potentially lead to a mess if a future
    device implements auto mode based on multiple different sensors

Cons:
- must have zero influence on brightness_set[_blocking] callbacks
  in order not to break triggers
  - potential interference with triggers and the brightness attribute,
    can't solve #2
- weird semantic (an attribute other than "brightness" and "trigger"
  changes the brightness)

< private hardware control trigger (this series) >

Pros:
- mutually exclusive with other triggers and the brightness attribute
  (hence less chaos)
- semantic correctness
- acts as an aggregate switch to turn on/off auto mode even a future
  device implements auto mode based on multiple different sensors
  - extensibility (through trigger attributes)

Cons:
- complexity
