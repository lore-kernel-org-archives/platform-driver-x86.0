Hmm... are you saying cpu online/offline designed to distinguish=20
with real cpu plug/unplug?
but, what the actual usage of online/offline?
forgive my foolish.

e.g. for QEMU case, if hot-plug a cpu,
we have to online a cpu manually if there's=20
no user space support like udev to do it automatically.
and also, I think maybe online/offline should be naturally
integrated with real plug/unplug process of CPU.
