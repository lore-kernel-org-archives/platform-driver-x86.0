Hi Old=C5=99ich,=20

Per our log.
It's a interesting and weird situation.

Your log subvert my assumption, the BT HW key only emit one
KEY_BLUETOOTH from ec but not from acer-wmi.

Per your lshal log, looks like HAL only receive the key event from EC
but didn't have key event from acer-wmi:

*** 22:21:01.310: lshal: device_condition,
udi=3D/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/platform_i8042_i8042_KBD_port_logica=
ldev_input
           condition_name=3DButtonPressed
           condition_details=3Dbluetooth			//it's from standard input

*** 22:21:02.076: lshal: property_modified,
udi=3D/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/platform_acer_wmi_rfkill_acer_blueto=
oth_bluetooth, key=3Dkillswitch.state
           is_removed=3Dfalse, is_added=3Dfalse
*** new value: 1 (0x1)  (int)				//UNBLOCK when you press BT HW key


So, there have only one KEY_BLUETOOTH from ec, acer-wmi didn't emit it.=
 I thought your
machine didn't support Acer ACPI event GUIDs. Please dump the dsdt to m=
e, thank's:
	acpidump > acpidump.dat

Then, if there only have one KEY_BLUETOOTH, why the global BT state did=
n't change by
rfill-input? Technically, rfkill-input must receive this key then chang=
e global state:

your situation:
		initial		press HW key
acer-wmi	BLOCK		UNBLOCK (changed by acer-wmi polling)
global		BLOCK		 BLOCK (why didn't changed by rfkill-input?)	=09
hci0		none		 BLOCK (replicate from global)

Like you said, the odd thing is:
	"Why rfkill-input didn't receive KEY_BLUEOOTH from ec on your machine?=
"

We need find out root cause, but I thought my last patch still works to=
 fix your
situation and it make sense for Acer BIOS didn't really persistence dev=
ices state.

applied my patch:
		initial		press HW key
acer-wmi	BLOCK		UNBLOCK (changed by acer-wmi polling)
global		UNBLOCK		UNBLOCK (didn't changed by rfkill-input?)	=09
hci0		none		 UNBLOCK (replicate from global)


Conclusion...
please kindly help to provide the following information:

 - Please provide DSDT to me
 	+ I want to double check your BIOS didn't support acer wmi event.

 - Why rfkill-input didn't call by BT HW key?
	+ please remember disable urfkill daemon, it might disabled rfkill-inp=
ut!
	+ please provide dmesg and messages log to me


Thank's a lot!
