Good catch! Your observation for first 12 bytes passes also for my=20
checks.

Next 4 bytes (after possible checksum) at 0x10 are always same:
0x44 0x53 0x00 0x01.

And I guess this should be compression header. In time of Win9x=20
Microsoft had own non-standard compression for disks called DoubleSpace.=20
IIRC it was some modification of LZ77 algorithm. And 0x44 0x53 0x00 0x01=20
is DS01. Maybe it is really DoubleSpace compression used for binary MOF?

I'm going to find specification of that old compression algorithm...

Hm.. right they are present in decompiled MOF file in Description field.

In that header file generated by wmiofck.exe I see definitions for BFn.=20
And there are also sizes for BFn buffers, together with some types.
