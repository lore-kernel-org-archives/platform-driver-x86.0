Hi,

this is the revised patch set to add the support for Dollar Cove TI
PMIC found on some Intel Cherry Trail laptops / tablets.  All drivers
are based on the original code from Intel downstream patches, with
lots of rewrites and cleanups.  MFD driver is implemented as a
stand-alone like a few other variants, and the input driver got a diet
in a minimalistic form.

The patch set has been tested on ASUS E100H and E200H, as well as on
HP x210.

v1->v2:
- Minor cleanups in mfd driver code as suggested by Andy
- Move power-button driver to platform/x86, driver renames accordingly
- Add missing wake-irq cleanup to power-button driver
- get_raw_temp cleanup in opregion driver, mention about register
  endianess


thanks,

Takashi
