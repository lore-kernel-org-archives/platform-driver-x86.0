Well.. triggers kind of assume they control the LED. They were not
prepared to deal with hardware changing the brightness behind their
back.

Can you elaborate on that?

I just tried with leds on thinkpad

root@duo:/sys/class/leds/tpacpi::power# echo 1 > brightness
root@duo:/sys/class/leds/tpacpi::power# echo 0 > brightness
root@duo:/sys/class/leds/tpacpi::power# cat trigger
[none] bluetooth-power kbd-scrollock kbd-numlock kbd-capslock
kbd-kanalock kbd-shiftlock kbd-altgrlock kbd-ctrllock kbd-altlock
kbd-shiftllock kbd-shiftrlock kbd-ctrlllock kbd-ctrlrlock AC-online
BAT0-charging-or-full BAT0-charging BAT0-full
BAT0-charging-blink-full-solid rfkill0 phy0rx phy0tx phy0assoc
phy0radio phy0tpt mmc0 timer pattern rfkill1 hci0-power rfkill74
heartbeat
root@duo:/sys/class/leds/tpacpi::power#

I can control the LED from userspace, but then there's no way to put
the LED back to firmware control. That's just broken.

Do you have a proposal how to handle that?

Well, lets ignore those voices until the voices understand the current
design :-).
