That's not an addition of mine, I moved it from eeepc_wmi_parse_device()
to eeepc_wmi_probe() so that everything behaves exactly as before.
(See the deleted lines further up in the patch.)

The last patch in the series concerned Intel ASoC (sound/soc/intel/)
and the maintainer Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org> has replied that
"This will collide with some other work done on the Intel code in -next I
expect, probably best to merge this via ASoC (so pulling a shared branch
for the new API) or just wait till 4.5 to do the conversion."
[full quote of his message as it wasn't cc: platform-driver-x86]

So I guess Mark might pull it in, haven't heard back from the ACPI
maintainers yet.
