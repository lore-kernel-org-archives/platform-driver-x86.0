Yes, I agree that discarding everything would be better approach. I can
see if this all can be shifted to ACPI and away form i2c. We'll need
something similar for atmel devices on some chromebooks too.

I do not see minimizing number of drivers as a goal. I also expect that
devices that get one driver wrong would require more fixups. As far as
having multiple config options - you do realize that even if we move
these chunks into existing drivers they can still be protected by config
options?

Would you mind telling me what is s horrible about this bug that
requires it to be fixed immediately. In practical terms please.

Well, if you want to get in a tizzy over this - its your kernel.

Yes, that is surely the rule. We do not merge the code until it is
absolutely, 100% bug free. That is why are about to release 4.11 and
stable 4.9 is at 25.

Look, it was missed, it was fixed, the bug was judged not critical
enough to drop everything and merge immediately. If you show how the bug
can affect real users I am sure Darren will expedite its merging.

Thanks.
