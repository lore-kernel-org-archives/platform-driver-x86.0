If you want to enjoy the ALS driven backlight control (I see here 
disabled) you should also compile and run the daemon at 
http://git.zx2c4.com/sony-acpid/

That because the SPIC device is still present but probably unused (can 
we avoid to initialize it?) since everything goes through the SNC 
device. I don't know if models using both the SNC and SPIC devices 
exist. Mattia?

Right.

Try using the autodimming feature and try turning off the optical device 
and maybe the touchpad (control files in 
/sys/devices/platform/sony-laptop/ should be more or less 
self-explanatory but ask if you need). I can't say much about this, sorry.
