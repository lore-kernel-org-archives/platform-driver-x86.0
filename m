Hi Jonathan,
thanks for the extensive review.
I can answer some of your questions, those related to the taos driver in
particular need to wait for Javier as large part of the work was plain
reverse engineering the windows code that he did.

I don't think there is any resistance per-se and to some extent it has
been done in the past (see meye.ko).
On the other hand there is no documentation on the devices this driver
is about and any abstraction you put in place to generalize access and
to allow splitting functionalities, will break. I have to admit that
things have somehow settled recently (and the Vaio brand has just been
buried, we'll see what happens) so making an attempt may make sense
now.
But then again, I'm not sure that making a mini-subsystem out of an
undocumented device/interface is going to pay out.

we can certainly try. :)
Though some functionalities are so interdependent from each other that
I'm not sure it makes much sense (backlight Fn-keys, panel backlight and
als are the worst).

I need to figure out what regmaps are about (a quick look in
include/linux/regmap.h reveals a lot), this is going to be a piece of
work.

most of the backlight code here is really a workaround to a sick
behaviour that vaios have once you enable the als device. It's generally
unrelated to the als portion of the driver except that once you
introduce the latter, the former will break. The code is folded together
to avoid being broken at any stage but it can be split to different
changes if it makes more sense.

it does indeed but I wasn't expecting this enourmous blob to go through
unnoticed and this is the type of feedback I wanted to get this code
unstuck and finally ready for inclusion.

I'll go through your comments in a few iterations to clean up the
obvious first and evaluate the larger rework (i.e. merging with the
current taos driver and splitting the als portion of sony-laptop) with
more stable code at hand.

Most of the questions you have about the driver itself will need to be
answered by Javier though, I have only a few comments below about
generic code in sony-laptop.c.

iirc, sonypi doesn't have enough known functionality to cover the
standard interfaces, it largely predates most of them. It's quite
some time I don't look into it and it's actually a legacy device that
is likely better be deprecated than worked on. If anybody wants to take
it on, I'm not opposed though.

err, this hunk should not have made it here at all. Part of the other
backlight work is in this patch for the reason I explained above but
this one is really extraneous.

ah, a multi function device. Again I'd need to look how it would look
like adding that to sony-laptop but these are essentially for triggering
acpi events.
Would it make it that much more clean than decoding the event from the
GPE notification callback and sending it via ACPI's netlink interface
(which is all we are doing here)?

yes, I can add documentation but this is not als specific.
In general SNC exposes a number of "handles" (those you see above) in an
indexed table (see find_snc_handle). All event notifications and calls
into the device methods (SN06 and SN07 are the entry points) specify the
offset at which the desired handle is.
Each handle cover one or more functionality based on the arguments provided.
Different handle may cover similar functionalities and are different
from model to model. 

The functionalities are easier to see in sony_nc_function_setup where
each handle has it's corresponding setup function called.

The event decoding here (sony_nc_notify) have to look at what handle is
associated to it and decide accordingly (map a hotkey, read a switch
position, read additional "light" event information).

what do you mean? do you have an example I can look at?
