I didn't realize the use_native_backlight option was in acpi/video.c.
Nevemind what I said, leave this crazyness to stay in the acpi world
only then.
Don't you still have ordering issues though? can the raw device be
loaded after video_detect runs?

this seems to be a way more wide case than today's code that combines it
with quirks or the kernel option.

well, in my limited experience I have seen userspace anyway blacklist
the sony/acpi backlight control for the intel one since it is available
regardless of acpi and gives (actually used to give) better granularity.

it is already... the problem is really the AML code, when the ALS device
is enabled a different code path is run in _BCM[1]. A call to _BCM
results in a Notify(SNC) rather than changing brigthenss level. SNC
needs to be able to see what is the new brightness level and set it.
I think having the backlight subsystem to allow drivers to cooperate
nicely instead of stomping on each other is the best way to go around
this.

the hotkeys go through the vendor/platform driver for vaios.

But anyway, I think the specific discussion about sony-laptop doesn't
belong to here, what I wanted to mention was that there's other use
cases and maybe changing approach to a runtime cooperation rather than
being exclusive at load time may be a workable option. Of course there
will be all sort corner cases with either approach.

[1]: just for reference here is the snippet from a vaio SSDT:
BRTL is the value returned in _BCQ, what SNC knows is that there was a
brightness change request, not actioned.

                    If (Local1)
                    {
                        Store (One, ALER)
                        Store (Arg0, BRTL)
                        Notify (\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.SNC, 0x93)
                    }
                    Else
                    {
                        Store (Zero, ALER)
                        If (LAnd (LGreaterEqual (Arg0, Zero), LLessEqual (Arg0, 0xFF)))
                        {
                            If (LGreaterEqual (OSYS, 0x07DC))
                            {
                                Store (Subtract (Match (ICL1, MEQ, Arg0, MTR, Zero, 0x02), 0x02
                                    ), Local0)
                                Store (DerefOf (Index (RTL1, Local0)), Local0)
                            }
                            Else
                            {
                                Store (Subtract (Match (ICL0, MEQ, Arg0, MTR, Zero, 0x02), 0x02
                                    ), Local0)
                                Store (DerefOf (Index (RTL0, Local0)), Local0)
                            }

                            \_SB.PCI0.GFX0.AINT (One, Local0)
                            Store (Arg0, BRTL)
                        }
                    }
