I'd prefer if you left the include outside of thinkpad_acpi.h, and just fix
the include in the two ALSA users.

We might add some extra stuff to thinkpad_acpi.h someday, and not everything
thinkpad_acpi does that might be useful to export to other areas of the
kernel would require acpi.h.

Looking at patch_conexant and patch_realtek, it might be better to actually
move the "am I running on a thinkpad" stuff they use acpi.h for into
thinkpad_acpi, and provide a prototype for that in thinkpad_acpi.h.
