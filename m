Sorry, still not getting this. How should this ever work if the intel
video driver is compiled as kmod? That means that it isn't clear at all
when the kmod is going to be loaded or if it is loaded at all, you
cannot delay the registration of the acpi backlight that long, since the
time you'd have to wait is basically unbounded...

So, how could this ever work?

AFAICS all popular distros ship the video drivers as kernel modules,
hence trying to avoid registration of the ACPI backlight if the intel
driver is compiled will be an entirely pointless excercise on all
distros?

What am I missing?
