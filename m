For the vast majority of platforms, the WMI interface would not be exported, and
we would not attempt to write audit filters. As a rule, I would expect this
effort to be triggered by a request from the vendor, and done only with their
explicit involvement after providing complete documentation of the WMI
interface.

However, we would expect those filters to deny as few calls as possible for the
platforms that choose to export the WMI interface to userspace.

For example, dell-wmi.c would be largely unaffected as the EVENT_GUID is not
interesting for userspace (per Mario) and would not be exported. The Descriptor
GUID should be safe to share with userspace, at least for the way we use it in
the kernel. Similar for dell-wmi-aio.c

For dell-wmi-led.c, we could most likely not export the GUID at all, but if we
did, we could choose to filter on device_id or command from the bios_args used
in the input buffer.

I don't think I've seen exactly what the WMI interface for the existing SMBIOS
stuff will look like, but we seem to have a fairly structured way of accessing it
today, which should allow us to filter out those specific usages (such as
rfkill). Additionally, the concern that userspace can make use of the same
mechanism as the kernel is where we are today with libsmbios.

With WMI filters, we could, for example, deny all DELL_SMBIOS_WMI GUID calls
equivalent to "class 17, select 11" (Wireless control), since that is handled
internally. Similarly for "4,11" (KBD ALS).

We address this with more granular filters.

As above, we won't write them for every wmi kernel driver. Only for those
vendors which engage with us to do so.

I agree we would want to avoid this. As this is off by default and only enabled
/ implemented with the cooperation of the vendor in the first place, I suspect
this kind of antagonistic interaction is unlikely.

You previously mentioned doing a vendor specific interface. This was my initial
response as well, but it doesn't meet the intent of the WMI interface, nor the
needs of vendors like Dell. That is, it requires a priori knowledge of all
current and future interfaces, and/or the continued gating on the Linux kernel
in order to allow a new method/interface. Further, by creating these interfaces,
we become more tied to them, and they will grow over time, until they are a very
large set of mostly deprecated interfaces which we can't remove for legacy
reasons.

All that said, I appreciate the concerns you've raised and they mirror many of
my own. I don't think we can just say "no, Windows Management Instrumentation is
only accessible in Linux within the kernel" as that is ultimately contrary to
the purpose of the mechanism. With those concerns in mind, I proposed the
general approach below which affords considerable freedom for vendors to manage
their systems while retaining the right to deny access to the existing Linux
kernel drivers. At the same time, it provides a general purpose interface to
userspace which won't collect legacy code we have to maintain forever.
