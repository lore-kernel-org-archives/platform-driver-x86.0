So, if there is nothing wrong with mutex use by itself...

Thinkpad-acpi calls the thinkpad firmware (using normal ACPI method calls),
which does SMI traps into the SMBIOS to do whatever it wants done.  And that
includes writing to the NVS (both the peecee RTC CMOS, and ACPI-backed
"NVS").

Something weird going on with CPU hotplug could throw Lenovo's
way-too-complex-for-comfort SMM firmware out of wack alright.

That can be checked.  Lobotomize the driver so that it does not do the acpi
calls in the suspend path (but keep everything else).  If it still locks, it
is not the firmware.
