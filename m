Yes, that's one idea I was thinking about. For all the machines I've
been able to get tested, if the gmux is present then it can control the
backlight and acpi_video cannot, so that approach is reasonable for
Macs.

There are quite a few machines in this situation though, and whatever
solution is arrived at should be flexible enough to work beyond just
Macs. I'll try to find some time soon to explore this further and see i=
f
I can come up with something.
