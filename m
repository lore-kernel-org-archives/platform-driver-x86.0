Hi Vadim,

You mentioned that these can vary by platform, I presume that means that
any given platform will present a subset of these attributes - but that
all possible attributes are documented here. Is that correct?

These property names do not seem to follow any kind of logical pattern
with respect to abbreviation. Starting with "cause_" made me think they
were event generators at first... Of course, who wants to be able to
generate an asic thermal shutdown from sysfs... ;-)

The only thing that might make more sense to *me* would be to replace
"cause" with "reset". Not required. I'll leave it to you, you may have
good reason for the names chosen.

Some description is appropriate here for what values it accepts and how
it is intended to be used.

This Description is awkward. Consider:

These files allow asserting system power cycling and switching power
supply units on and off.

Please provide usage and resulting behavior.
