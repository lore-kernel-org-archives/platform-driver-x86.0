Yes that is part of the work that is in progress.
The LED driver should be able to register either a single color LED or a group of colored LEDs.

This can be based on a firmware entry and which LED framework the driver chooses to register to. Either the
multicolor framework or the base LED framework.  Of course we can put this in code and keep it
out of the firmware nodes again thats why it is wip.

I have convert a couple of drivers over in my testing that support RGB modules or have a RGB cluter used to mix
colors.

If the product wants to expose a single red LED via the label then they use legacy registration.
If the product wants to expose RGBW as a single group then the multicolor framework should be registered too.
