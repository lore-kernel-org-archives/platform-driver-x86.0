Hardware doesn't support hotplug of EPC as the EPC size and location
is locked during activation of SGX.  And IIRC, activation of SGX must
be synchronized across all CPUs in a multi-socket platform, e.g. you
can't late-enable SGX on a socket and due hotplugging that way.

In a virtualized environment there are no such restrictions.  I am not
aware of any explicit requirements or use cases for supporting hotplug
of EPC, but that's probably only because virtualization of SGX is
fairly nascent.
