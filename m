So I have a problem with this design pattern so I need to ask
Matthew Garret about this:

- Driver *always* performs some port-mapped I/O probe on
  some random ports as a compulsory initcall.

- No other hardware discovery.

- If detecting magic, registers a platform device.

- Then handles this device by also providing a device
  driver for it.

- All of this is placed in one file.

Matthew is this how discovery and registration of x86 platform
drivers for port-mapped devices should work or are we doing
something weird here?

Since earlier we have:

drivers/gpio/gpio-f7188x.c - exactly the same pattern

drivers/gpio/gpio-it8761e.c - doesn't even bother to create a platform
  device, goes on and creates a gpio_chip without any device

drivers/gpio/gpio-sch.c - port-mapped but platform device is
  created by an MFD which is probed from PCI (seems fine).

drivers/gpio/gpio-ts5500.c - aha, created from
  arch/x86/platform/ts5500/ts5500.c, a "board file".

This is a bit heterogeneous, but I can't claim to understand how
x86 want to register its devices so need some input here.

Maybe this is all the right way to do things, but I want to
be hammered down by some convincing arguments first.
