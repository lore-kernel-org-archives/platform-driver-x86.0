Wait, why are you using rcu at all for this?  This is not a "heavy"
operation that you need to care about speed for, right?  Why get rcu
involved at all in this type of thing?

Yes, the links in the driver core seem to be using rcu, which I didn't
notice until right now, and I can't remember why or when that happened.
Let's not make this more complex than it has to be please.

Sorry I missed this the last review cycles.
