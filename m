Ok, I understand.

FWIW althought the first patch is a core change it is not really a big
one and won't impact any existing drivers, but I fully understand
you still want to take your time to review it.

Andy (Shevchenko) can you perhaps take a look at the first patch
in this series and give your opinion on it ?

Yes that dep should make 4.14.

I've some other patches pending which require further changes to the
intel_cht_int33fe driver (*), so I think it would be best if the last
patch got merged through the platform/x86 tree. The dependencies
between patch 2-3 are runtime only (and not fatal if missing, just
inconvenient) so merging this to 2 separate trees should be fine
as long as both patches get merged for 4.15.

Hans


*) The intel_cht_int33fe and i2c/busses/i2c-cht-wc drivers together
instantiate 4 i2c devices which together make all the "magic" behind
the Type-C connector on these boards happen. The patch-series
completed by these 3 patches ties 3 of the 4 drivers together so
that charging and battery monitoring fully works. Ideally all 4
i2c-clients would be instantiated from a single place, e.g.
intel_cht_int33fe.c, but the charger is hooked up through a "child"
i2c bus on the pmic, which is where i2c/busses/i2c-cht-wc.c
comes into play.

The next series adds support for the 4th chip, the type-c cross-switch/
mux which is necessary to get superspeed usb and/or displayport working
over the Type-C connector.
