IMO the whole vaildation should depend on a command line option (in case
this is a system without S3 and the user has no choice really), but it should
check the package state residency in the first place.

I guess this means I would make it a "bail out if you can't go as deep as X"
with X possibly equal to "the deepest package state" or "SLP_S0".
