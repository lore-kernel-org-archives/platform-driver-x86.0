Currently we have the following modules where ACPI instance is used in:

drivers/acpi/acpi_lpss.c
drivers/input/touchscreen/goodix.c
drivers/platform/x86/silead_dmi.c
drivers/power/supply/axp288_charger.c

and plenty under sound/soc/intel.

I do not care right now about sound/soc/intel stuff, while everywhere
else would be better to avoid this.

Mika, Rafael, what're yours opinions regarding to use ACPI instances
in the drivers?

For me it sounds fragile.
