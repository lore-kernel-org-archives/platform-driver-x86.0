I'm not really sure what is the best approach.

But in my opinion, if somebody call blocking function symbol_request()
then after function return, caller wants to use this symbol and expects
to be ready. Therefore I think that exported function
(dell_micmute_led_set) should probably ensure that everything is
initialized and after that continue... So maybe add "initialize & wait
until backends are ready" code into beginning of that function?
