OK in summary:

ASUS X71S - Doesn't boot without nolapic
ASUS F50SV - Doesn't boot without nolapic (latest tried and working 2.6.31)
ASUS N61JQ - X out of Y shutdown hangs (Cured with nolapic too)

Note that nolapic is the finer grained fix. acpi=off fixes the issue too.

Doesn't seem to be related to idle as processor.max_cstates=0 didn't help.

This is 2.6.37, intel_idle enabled with 2 upstream patches mentioned 
before + the mm fix.
