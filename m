Ok, if WMI interface would be exported to userspace only after previous
communication with vendor, then this should be OK. It also means that we
need to maintain list of WMI GUIDs...

I expect that vendor would be communicate with kernel developers and
filters would be written with agreement with vendor. This seems OK.

Benefit of vendor specific API is code de-duplication and having common
functions in one place. E.g. code for changing SMBIOS token does not
have to be implemented in both userspace and kernel, just in kernel.

Also handling generic API requests from userspace in kernel and then
pass them to firmware is a bit harder and less error prone. Also audit
filters would be less easier...

I still think that we do not have to export WMI as is to userspace and
personally I do not think it is the best solution even if Microsoft is
doing it...

But if we are unable to design such API and vendor (e.g. Dell) already
wants WMI API in userspace, then we probably should export it from them.

The main concern is that WMI is something like meta-API or RPC. In most
cases it would be needed to write "wrapper" code around to do call
needed functions or do something. It is needed to written in kernel
(e.g. for class drivers or for filters), but also vendor needs to
duplicate functionality in userspace. And this does not seems to be
ideal, probably it can be design-antipattern.

As wrote above, I'm fine with explicit whitelist of WMI GUIDs which will
be exported to userspace after communication with vendor.

One more thing: We should not provide new interface API/ABI between
kernel and userspace without some open source implementation of
userspace. This is IIRC some Linus's rule. And I'm not sure if vendors
are going to provide some userspace WMI implementations as open
source...
