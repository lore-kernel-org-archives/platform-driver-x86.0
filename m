Copy'n'paste and maintain two lists.
Yes, it's not the ideal, but working solution.

You may put a comment before each list to explain what the second does
and tell a contributor to look at it and update if needed.

> Having one file where it would be defined is a bad idea for you.

Not just "one file", but "one *header* file". Or "exporting a symbol"
which is basically not supposed to be exported.
ID tables are part of the actual drivers, neither headers, nor libraries.

I don't like it. I'll not take it, sorry.
