Do you understand that the usb_skeleton.c file is totally inappropriate 
as a model for a mass-storage driver?

Google is your friend.  But see the answer to your next question...

There is no such thing as the SCSI transparent command set.  "SCSI 
transparent" means "use whatever command set the relevant SCSI standard 
specifies".

There is non-Linux source code for mass-storage drivers in other
open-source operating systems.

Fix your driver.  It's not possible to give a more complete answer 
without further information.
