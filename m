My fault, sorry. I should have clarified earlier that my patch was
based off of pdx86 tree[1] (master branch). Regarding the patch yes,
by mistake I ended up disabling the whole hwmon device (not what we
want). Let's register the hwmon device first then later handle the fan
logic optionally with the count guards.

Now hwmon should be available but pwm1_enable will be hidden. Also,
fan{1,2}_input is expected to be visible, I am not sure why it isn't
showing up for your device.

(as usual, rest all errors would be same)

>> >> * fan1_input - Absent because get fan speed query must be failing.
