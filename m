That's interesting. I don't *ever* boot with the QS button; I get the
keycodes when I boot normally. I tried the QS button precisely once, but
only *after* I blew away the original contents of the hard drive with my
MeeGo installation, so it didn't boot.

Do you know how to restore it? Or do you have a copy of the 'lenovo-ec'
module that it apparently contains?

I did keep the Windows restore partition, just in case I needed to go
back to it to get wireless working. But when I tried to recover, it told
me it didn't like my partition table -- so I fixed that and next time I
booted into the OS recovery, it just dumped me at a command prompt and
didn't even manage to start the graphical recovery tool.
