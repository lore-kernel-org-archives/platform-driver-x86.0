It was our interpretation from the SDM that the identity modulus
signature MSR's are 'trap-door' registers.  If flexible launch control
(FLC) is enabled the platform has one opportunity to write a new
signature value, after which the registers are locked from
modification until the next platform reset.

From a security architecture perspective it seemed that an FLC based
SGX implementation would use a modified version of TBOOT to securely
write that register once per platform boot/reset.  The architecture
that is being discussed where there is a need to continually check
whether or not the correct root signing key is loaded sounds a bit
clunky at best.

At worst it has potential security implications since it is the
reponsibility of the enclave launch control infrastructure to control
which enclaves are allowed to have the PROVISION_KEY attribute bit
set.

Have a good weekend.
