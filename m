True, so you are suggesting that I define a bq24190_platform_data
struct with a regulator_init_data pointer in there I guess?

At least I would not want to just claim that pointer for
just regulator_init_data and more-over assuming that what
is in there will be regulator_init_data feels wrong.

I don't think the power-supply maintainers will be enthusiastic
about this (hi Sebastian). But that does make sense and is
actually a good idea for tackling the problem of regulator_init_data.

It is not just device-instantiation ordering, it is also driver
loading order, the event around which ordering needs to happen is
the registration of the regulator (as things are now).

So the pwm subsys has this pwm_add_table thing which can add lookup
entries indepdentent of pwm_registration and which uses supply/device_name
matching to find the entry for the caller of pwm_get which is the same as
the current lookup code in the regulator-core, but since it is
independent of the registration the lookup-table does not contain
direct pointers to pwmchip-s instead it uses a string which gets
matches against the pwm (parent) dev's dev_name().

Would extending the struct regulator_map with a const char *provider_name:

struct regulator_map {
         struct list_head list;
         const char *dev_name;   /* The dev_name() for the consumer */
         const char *supply;
         struct regulator_dev *regulator;
	const char *provider;	/* The dev_name() for the regulator parent-dev */
};

And having a regulator_add_lookup function which adds an entry to the
regulator_map_list which sets provider_name instead of regulator
be acceptable ?

lookup of such entries would look for regulators where supply
matches the regulator-name and provider matches the
regulators parent-dev-name.

Alternatively the entry could additionally contain a provider_supply_name
so that we can make arbitrary consumer-dev-name + consumer-supply-name
provider-dev-name + provider-supply-name matches. That would probably
be more flexible then requiring the supply name to match.

So would something like this (including returning -EPROBE_DEFER if there
is a pwm_map_list entry and no matching regulator can be found) acceptable ?

Ok.
