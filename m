Thank's for your suggestion, I just goolge it:
 http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-input/msg10336.html

And, you are right, it's a very good framework for keymap handler.
I will modify patch to use sparse keymap library.

I believe it already available in newest kernel.
Does it already in 2.6.32 kernel? Because I also need backport those 2
patches to 2.6.32.x kernel.


Thank's
Joey Lee
