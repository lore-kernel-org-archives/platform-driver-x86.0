Do older kernels not have DMI support?  I would think that if an 
enterprise distribution wanted this driver they would likely already 
have DMI support backported as well.

Or they can work with me to find a way that works in that kernel.  I was 
thinking that in the current (and future) kernel, DMI was the best way 
to go.

I went for a better safe than sorry route.  Before I added the DMI 
checking I had some reports of this getting loaded on non-IBM hardware 
and it came up with some nasty error messages.  I figured since I knew 
exactly which platforms have support, I could just limit the driver to 
those.  Then there is the force parameter that allows a user to ignore 
the DMI data and try to load the driver anyway.
