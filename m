The led stops working after 4th patch "platform/x86: dell-laptop:
import dell_micmute_led_set() from drivers/leds/dell-led.c", and the
.config is with CONFIG_DELL_LAPTOP=3Dm

However, I found dell-laptop is not loaded on Latitude 7480 as its
chassis type is Notebook (10), instead of 8 (Portable) or 9 (Laptop).
That's also what I see for newer Dell laptops.

After I added the below entry into dell-laptop, the led works fine.
This is not in kernel 4.10 rc8 either, and I will submit a patch for
it.

        {
                .matches =3D {
                        DMI_MATCH(DMI_SYS_VENDOR, "Dell Inc."),
                        DMI_MATCH(DMI_CHASSIS_TYPE, "10"), /*Notebook*/
                },
        },
