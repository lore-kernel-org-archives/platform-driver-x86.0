No, this is BS. User selecting, for example, a button driver should not
care that it is working in polling mode only and needs polled device
library to work. As it was said before, drivers need to depend on major
subsystems and select minors and library modules.

The fact that our Kconfig can't really provide us with the functionality
we desire (be it because the logic is fuzzy and hard to formalize or
some other reason) shoud not force "NO SELECT" policy, we just need to
be careful when using it.

Thanks.
