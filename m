=46air enough. Clear, legible, consistent coding is preferable to a few=
 micro
optimizations that the compiler is likely to catch anyway. I withdraw t=

=46or -1, I should think  -EIO (I/O Error)
=46or -2, I'd expect -ENXIO (No such device or address)

Cc Rafael, Mika, linux-acpi in case they have a better idea.

OK, that deserves a comment then as the rationale isn't obvious.

The goal here is to avoid more than 3 levels of indentations for improv=
ed
legibility. Often there are logical inversions and such we can make to
accomplish this. When that fails, we break things up into functions, st=
atic
inlines, etc.

=46or reference:

Which elaborates on CodingStyle Chapter 1: Indentation a bit.

This is a nit, but one other maintainers have imposed on me, as a means=
 to
improve legibility. The preference is to declare variables in decreasin=
g line
length, longest to shortest:

struct kbd_state new_state;
struct kbd_state state;
bool convert;
int value;
u8 unit;
char ch;
int ret;
int i;

This is a generalization and sometimes there are good reasons for doing
something else, such as logical groupings for commenting groups, etc. B=
ut since
this list appeared mostly random, defaulting to decreasing line length =
is
preferred.

Right, so the language of the comment just wasn't clear, try:

/* Convert value from seconds to minutes */
