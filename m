I think the idea is that having the backlight on can cause the main board
to heat up as there is often a regulator / pwm for the backlight on the
main board. If that is turned off it may help to cool down the main board,
so the backlight is a cooling device in the sense that when it is turned
off it stops generating heat.

If this makes sense (*) then the cooling device stuff should maybe moved
from the acpi/video.c code to the backlight core code.

Or does the acpi-video code use some info from the BIOS to determine
whether or not to register a cooling device ?

Regards,

Hans




*) This is tricky, e.g. going low brightness may cause the main board
to heat up more then full brightness depending on how things are hooked
up.



  Should that be untangled from the mess too?
