There was a misunderstanding of these semantics on my side, despite
this being documented in Documentation/rfkill.txt. Now I've realized
the semantic difference between 1."having all the individual switches
of a certain type blocked at a certain moment" and 2."blocking all
switches of a certain type": on the 1st situation, each switch was
individually blocked in different moments, and by chance a certain
type had all its registered switches blocked, while on the 2nd, all
switches of a certain type were blocked altogether using
RFKILL_OP_CHANGE_ALL. Only on the 2nd situation we want to update the
default state for hotplugged devices, and that's why
rfkill_global_states[type] is not updated when individual switches are
driven, even if we read situation 1. Then there is actually no
difference between the state value and the operation, and there is
nothing to be fixed on an individual switch change. Sorry for the
confusion.

I'm going to add a note about this behavior to
include/uapi/linux/rfkill.h as well.

Yes. I think we're actually saying the same thing with different words =
here.

Agreed, and we would still be in an "airplane safe" mode, but maybe a
too conservative one.

And when the fd gets released we would fallback to default, right? So
that would avoid two userpace apps trying to control it at the same
time, but not one after the other (which is a good thing). As I
understand it also implies we would not expose this control point
through sysfs.

Great, I already fixed the previous comments and started working on a
prototype of the second stage, but then a naming question came to my
mind. They way I'm designing it is to have only one trigger and change
its behavior when the "airplane mode indicator" is under userspace
control (basically changing when to call led_trigger_event() to fire
the trigger). In this case it probably makes sense to call the trigger
something like "rfkill-airplane_mode", as before, because it will fire
when we're in an "airplane safe" mode, controlled by userspace or with
a fallback default behavior.

Another option would be to have two separate triggers,
"rfkill-airplane_mode" controlled by userspace, and "rfkill-all"
implementing the default behavior, and change which trigger is set to
each LED *from the trigger implementation side* in rfkill. Unless I'm
missing something, I don't think this second approach is possible.

So the question is, if we go with the 1st approach, would it be fine
to call the trigger "rkill-airplane_mode", even for the first stage
when only the default behavior is implemented, or should I rename it
(which implies renaming an API to other drivers) during the 2nd stage
implementation? I think sticking with one name from the beginning is
better, but since it goes against previous feedback, I decided to ask
first.

I'll send patches for this soon.

Thanks for the feedback,
