I'm currently hitting a regression in 4.20-rc1 which causes it to not
boot on my Cherry Trail test devices (sdhci driver times out so it
cannot find its root filesystem).

I'm currently debugging this (it looks like I need todo a full bisect to
find the cause) once I've that working, if I hit something which look
likes you've described I will give this patch a test. But currently I
cannot reproduce the problem you describe.

As for patches 2-55, they look good to me:
