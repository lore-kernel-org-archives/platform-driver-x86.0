Hi All,

After some changes made during the 4.13 cycle, power button doesn't wake up
the system from suspend-to-idle any more on Surface Pro3.

It turns out that the platform expects EC events to be processed while
suspended for this to work (patch [1/2]) and the button driver needs to
report wakeup events properly too (patch [2/2]).

Thanks,
Rafael
