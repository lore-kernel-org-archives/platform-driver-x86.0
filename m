Ok. I thought device properties were supposed to unify dt and non-dt situations,
but apparently not. Oh well :-(.

Yes, one of those TODO items for moving the code out of staging. "fcs," should
possibly be "fusb302,", and int_n _is_ weird.

Yes, please.

Also, please copy Yueyao Zhu for the fusb302 changes in v2.
