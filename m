This patch is fine as is. However, Greg has supported propogating the error code
through to the sysfs interface (if I understand him correctly on an earlier post
to this list). This would require an addition change to this patch would
propogated the get_cpufv error code in show_available_cpuv(), show_cpuv(), and
store_cpuv(). As it is, we return -ENODEV on any failure, where an ACPI call
error should probably return -ENXIO as I understand it.

However, there was a rather famous change in error code handling in which pulse
audio broke and Linus was very upset with one of his maintainers.

How do we know when it is acceptable to change which error code is returned?
