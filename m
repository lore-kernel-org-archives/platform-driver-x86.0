But we already have the in-kernel solution that provides this behavior.
It is called rfkill-input and it is the in-kernel bridge between input
devices that emit KEY_WLAN etc. and rfkill switches. There is no need t=
o
have yet another mechanism (most likely fighting with default in-kernel
one) doing the same thing. So for boxes tat do support this launcher
mode we should simply enable it. _Always_.

And once the userspace manager[s] become standard we can just rely on
their presence. Like right now you can't really live without udev, dbus=
,
etc. if you want to have reasonably behaving box (embedded setups out o=
f
scope here).

>=20

And I do not think so for the reasons outlined. We have chosen the
direction already (dictated by the existence of keys not directly
connected withg RF switches) and we should follow through with it, so
all boxes and drivers behave as uniformly as possible.

Thanks.
