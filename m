Me too :)

I agree.  I don't want too see gnome-whatever-widget talking directly
to WMI and confusing the kernel driver for the same thing.

I haven't tried to see whether they do what's needed, but there's
OpenWBEM and OpenPegasus.

Anyway, if such a tool exists, it would be handy to expose the binary
MOF data to userspace so the tool could be used to help get WMI
working on new platforms.
