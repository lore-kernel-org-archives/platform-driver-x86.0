I agree, too.

Right, if a device is inhibited it shouldn't become a wakeup source,
because that would contradict the purpose of being inhibited.

What would it mean to become a wakeup source if there are no users,
or nobody has ever opened the device? There are no interested
input handlers (users) so what's the point of becoming a wakeup
source? Why would the system need to wake up?

Yes, please ;)

Of course.
