Yes, and this is reason why abstract generic interface has problems and=20

IMO, this will only results in more problems as we already have and does=20
not bring any value. Just anarchy, like in windows world.

And still, if write audit filters for every one existing wmi driver in=20
kernel, there still audit filter can say to userspace that current=20
request cannot be accepted and sent to firmware.

This would mean that userspace application would not be able to do ANY=20
WMI method call (as e.g. on windows) and so for some vendors it can be=20
useless.

And here I'm not sure, how hard would be to write those audit filters=20
for all wmi kernel drivers and if it would be possible without wmi=20
documentation of those vendor apis (which we do not have).

Potential vendors can decide based on above fact, that their userspace=20
application rather rmmod wmi kernel driver for particular GUID (which=20
release occupation of wmi device) and their userspace application starts=20
working. And this is I think situation which is bad for kernel and we=20
should prevent it.
