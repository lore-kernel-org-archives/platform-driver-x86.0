Hi Matthew,

Please consider merging the following patches. They represent a
signficant cleanup of toshiba_acpi as well as adding support for SPFC as
an HCI method. The latter provides basic but functional support for the
TOS1900 devices found on newer Toshiba models, which will serve as a
good starting point for further enhancements. I've tried to leave the
details of the hardware interaction unchanged to reduce the risk of
regression for machines already supported by the driver.

The patches are virtually identical to the RFC series I had sent a while
back, but with an additional patch to initialize the brightness in the
backlight device. 

Thanks,
Seth
