Hi,

I have worked on the same problem for the last days and just submitted
my solution proposal for review:
http://www.mail-archive.com/platform-driver-x86@vger.kernel.org/msg04440.html

One downside with the solution in this set of patches is that more
lines are added to the driver.
By making use of the i2c_driver.detect() mechanism like in my patch,
we can actually reduce the number of lines in the driver.

Looking forward to your comments on my other solution proposal!

/ Martin
