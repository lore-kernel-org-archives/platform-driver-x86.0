This was "toshiba_acpi: Change sci_open function return value"

Some Toshiba laptops have "poorly implemented" SCI calls on their
BIOSes and are not checking for sci_{open, close} calls, therefore,
the sci_open function is failing and making some of the supported
features unavailable (kbd backlight, touchpad, illumination, etc.).

This patch checks wheter we receive TOS_NOT_SUPPORTED and returns
1, making the supported features work on such laptops.

In the case that some laptops really do not support the SCI, all the
SCI dependent functions check for TOS_NOT_SUPPORTED, and thus, not
registering support for the queried feature.

Darren,

Hopefully this new patch eases some of the concerns of the previous
patch, and this time I added a comment block explaining a bit, but of
course, let me know if there is something else that needs change.

Cheers
Azael
