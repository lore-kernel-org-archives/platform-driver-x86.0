from errno(3):
       EIO             Input/output error (POSIX.1)
       ENXIO           No such device or address (POSIX.1)

It makes sense to retry EIO.  ENXIO means there's nobody listening at the
time, and isn't usually retried.

The device-based interfaces get it right.  A typical example is the
cpu-based devices, where ENXIO means "no such processor", while EIO means
"whatever you're trying to do failed",  so a MSR read would return ENXIO if
the processor core is offline/doesn't exist, and EIO if the processor core
is there, but raised a #GP when the MSR read was attempted.
