Sorry my bad. You should select this if you use it, but are you
using the GPIO MMIO abstractions?
The hallmark of those implementations are that they
call bgpio_init() and this driver does not, and it seems
with the funny layout of the registers it can't even use
it anyway.

Agreed.

No unfortunately not, because 0 is a valid GPIO base.
