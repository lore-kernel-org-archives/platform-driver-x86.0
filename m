Back in January 2016, I sent Andy a few minor comments about this
series.  A year later, I offered to iron out the remaining issues and
resubmit the series in Andy's name when I find the time.  Sadly, things
have changed a bit for me since that time and it is unlikely that I will
be able to deliver, for which I am sorry.

However, browsing Andy's branch I see that most issues have been
resolved, though I think some of my remarks [1] have either been missed
or silently refuted :)

Anyway, I also like this approach and I think this series is a valuable
cleanup.

Please pardon my ignorance, but what do we actually gain by exposing WMI
to userspace?  Enabling applications to fetch SMBIOS data?  We already
have an interface for that.  Enabling applications to receive input
events?  Likewise.  You mentioned WMI's efficiency compared to SMI/SMM,
but is it a difference significant enough for anyone to notice?

I am biased here as I have had my own struggles with WMI in the past,
but it looks like a layer of indirection which brings little value, yet
is tricky to expose properly.  If there is a real-life use case that
makes this idea worthwhile, I would love to be enlightened.

+1 for the idea, it makes figuring out what the firmware actually
exposes through WMI a bit easier.  After skimming through the driver's
code, I would only recommend to review the included headers
(linux/input/sparse-keymap.h, linux/dmi.h and acpi/video.h all seem
redundant to me).

What we still need, though, is an open source version of wmiofck.exe.  I
am unaware of anything like that existing and installing the Windows
Driver Kit just to run one command which spits out a single *.h file is
not something I would describe as convenient (been there).
