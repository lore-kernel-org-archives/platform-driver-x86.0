I wish this would work, but on the machine that I had, there was a valid
ACPI table for the video device, yet I was told to "ignore it, it
doesn't work and use the sabi interface instead", so this patch would
break that machine :(

We might want to trigger off of the machine type for this kind of
thing, that's the only way I can see this working properly.

So, sorry, I can't approve this patch.
