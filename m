Hi, Takashi and Henrique

Thanks for reviewing and commenting.

It looks to me like that there is a relationship between two Henrique's suggestions.
His opinion is all ACPI stuff should be bound into thinkpad_acpi.c, that's why he suggested not to include <linux/acpi.h> in <linux/thinkpad_acpi.h>.
So we might address both of them in order to follow.

I'm not sure if your opinion is: the hd-audio codec driver's needs cannot be met by addressing the second comment.
And I'm not the right person that is able to test such code restructuring work.
The target of this patchset is cleaning up wrong <acpi/acpi.h> inclusions, so let me focus on the first comment.

Can I just update this patch with <acpi/acpi.h> inclusions replaced by <linux/acpi.h> inclusions?

Thanks and best regards
