toshiba-acpi was always missing TOS6207 ID so it did not load automatically
on some laptops (such as Portege R100). But it worked fine if loaded manually.
Commit 135740de7764 ("toshiba_acpi: Convert to use acpi_driver") broke that
and the driver does not work even when loaded manually since then.

Add TOS6207 ID to fix it.

Tested on Toshiba Portege R100.
