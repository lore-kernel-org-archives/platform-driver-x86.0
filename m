Good point, done.

Hrm. There seems to be plenty of similar suggestions on the mailing lists, but
nothing documented in coding-style.rst. If this is a thing we are going to ask
of our contributors, it should be documented. I'm happy to reorder, would you
consider sending the coding-style patch?

Sure, done.

I took some time and compared this with:

read(2)
lseek(2)
fseek(3)
memory_read_from_buffer()

If offset is <0, we should return EINVAL
If offset is >end_of_buffer.... it's not so cut and dry. It is simpler to just
return 0, and as far as how it affects usage... returning 0 seems perfectly
acceptable for typical read loop usage.

As loff_t is a long long, it could conceivably be < 0, so I've added a check for
that and return -EINVAL in that case.

Agreed, changed.

Thanks for the review Andy.
