Right, I admit that this looks complete nonsense.

It is SHA256 hash of the construction of the enclave signed with the
private RSA key of the enclave signer (the public key is part of the
SIGSTRUCT).

A measurement is constructed by hashing tags for ECREATE, EADD and
EEXTEND together with those parameters that either define ordinal and
cardinal properties of the enclave associated with the operation and for
each EADD the associated data page is also hashed.

I will update this according the above explanation probably adding
section just for explaining what measurement means as it is a concept
that is cuts through the whole stack.

The CPU calculates it to variable inside the SECS page of the enclave
while you construct the enclave and a signing tool calculates equivalent
value and signs it with the private key (i.e. the signed measurement).

Thank this was really useful feedback.

I've been drowned in SGX long enough to become blind sometimes to what
is not obvious :-)
