Agreed, acpi_bus.h is tightly coupled with acpi.h. The practice I've
seen from others and want to discourage / avoid is including acpi.h and
then deleting ... say...  spinlock.h because somewhere somehow acpi.h
also pulls it in. They are not tightly coupled conceptually, so
spinlock.h should remain in the include list if the file uses spinlocks
directly. I think we're in violent agreement here :-)
