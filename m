Removing init because it's included by module.h, and removing acpi_bus.h
because it's included by acpi.h - but not because it can be built as a
module - right?  Just checking, the wording in the commit msg seemed odd
to me.

These removals seem appropriate to me, but so we have it recorded here -
in general, including headers that you explicitly make use of is good
practice, and not depending on others to include them. But in this case,
the implicit includes are reasonable expectations as they are tightly
coupled with the parent include.
