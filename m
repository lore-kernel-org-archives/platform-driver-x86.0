This driver is only used on 2008+ MacBook Pros and the 2013+ Mac Pro,
all of which have PCI and are pretty much unusable with CONFIG_PCI=n.

So it is okay to just add "depends on PCI" for this driver, as you did
with other drivers, and I think that's preferrable to an #ifdef.

You can also drop the "platform/x86: " prefix from the subject if you
like, all previous commits to this driver just use "apple-gmux: ".

If you are okay with these changes, feel free to add my Reviewed-by
when respinning.

Thanks,

Lukas
