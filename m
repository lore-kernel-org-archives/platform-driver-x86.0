Hi,

Here is v6 of my patch(es) to allow userspace to get notified about
hw initiated brightness changes.

As agreed upon before the API has been changed to introduce a new
hw_brightness_changed attribute for this.

This has been tested on a Dell XPS 15, I'm travelling atm so I've
not tested the new version of the thinkpad patch.

The platform patches here are included mostly as an example of
users of the new API, they are currently not intended for merging
as we first need to have the LED class API for this merged.

Regards,

Hans
