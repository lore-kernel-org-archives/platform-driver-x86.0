I guess this was so clear that Darren made the same assumption as me. I
also never said that it wouldn't work, which is why I used "pretty
sure", and asked questions.

From the looks of things, some devices only send the keypresses, and
never the key release, otherwise what would be the point of ignoring
the key release in that table, say for the volume buttons? It's clear
as mud, and there's no comments in the driver to explain that.

If you don't want to answer questions, or are going to be as pissy as
your replies have been, I'm happy to not continue reviewing your
patches. I find patch 2 unreadable, but it might be my tiny tiny little
brain.
