Thanks for the patch, my comments below.

First of all, I would like to see that this is about pm and pm only, so,
perhaps

intel_isp_pm ?

OTOH, it would be nice to have less confusing of what ISP we are talking about,
so,

intel_atomisp2_pm ?

If someone decides to port this to kernels where ATOMISP driver is still
available, it might be a conflict here. I dunno if it's a good idea to put
something like depends !ATOMISP here taking into consideration that it would be
staled option.

A nit: I would rather put it like

do {
...
} while (time_after(...));
