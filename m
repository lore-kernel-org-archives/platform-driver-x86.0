release() usually means that the object is destroyedm, i.e this action,
unlike close() is irrevocable.

Let's leave the names as is, and adjust kerneldoc comments as needed.

Yes, plugging into runtime PM would be nice, as as it currently stands
the driver will be broken with regard to trying access sysfs for
firmware update/calibration/etc if device happens to be inhibited.

The version of the driver in Chrome OS tree is similarly broken, but
because we control both kernel and the rest of the stack we know that we
do not poke at sysfs when device is inhibited. It will not be acceptable
for mainline (and that is one of reasons why elan_i2c does not have
open/close methods at the moment).

Thanks.
