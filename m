To add to that point, RTC wake ups are valid for fully waking up the
system. The clock event wake up wasn't used for waking up the system
before, so we know that we don't have to check if it should wake up
the system entirely. The way rtc timers work right now, I think that
we'd have to go all the way through resume devices to figure out if we
should resume to user space or freeze again.
