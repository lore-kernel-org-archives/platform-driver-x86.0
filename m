Actually this is wrong.

So... you don't want to use systemd, so don't use systemd. What is the
problem? :-)

If you have at most one application controlling each LED, you are
fine. That's quite common situation, serial port can also be opened at
most once. Do you actually have two applications accessing one led? If
so, what applications?

Yes, we _could_ do that. Would be slightly confusing
w.r.t. triggers. But is it good idea?

Userspace could easily keep /var/run/led/XXX/brightness, and inotify
works over regular files..

And yes, with three color LEDs, userspace daemon managing LED state
will be pretty much mandatory...
