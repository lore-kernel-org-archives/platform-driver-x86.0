I don't think it is relevant here. The driver uses only wired OR
interrupt which is provided in _CRS of the device.

I misread it, sorry about that.

Can you check if you have:

  Hardware Reduced (V5) : 1

in that FADT table?

If yes, it probably does not have the normal Fixed power button but
instead it has something called "Windows button array device" with
_HID/_CID of PNP0C40. Looking at your dsdt.dsl, this looks to be the
case.

That device is driven by soc_button_array.c driver which can be enabled
with CONFIG_KEYBOARD_GPIO=y and CONFIG_INPUT_SOC_BUTTON_ARRAY=y. Can you
check if you have that enabled already?

You should actually see it in /proc/interrupts with names like "power"
and so on.
