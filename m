=46or backlight,=20
I think control backlight in platform driver is generally no problem,
but need careful don't keep/change brightness level if BIOS also keep a
variable reflect to brightness level.

Another question is when the "auto" mode disable? Does it possible
disable it from user space?
Currently, like rfkill-input can disabled by ioctl from user space, e.g=
=2E
urfkill daemon will disable rfkill-input by ioctl when it launched.


=46or rfkill,
I am not prefer allow platform driver direct control rfkill.

that might more complex because already have the follow components
involve to it when function key pressed:
	BIOS/EC (ODM backup behavior)
	rfkill-input
	wireless/bluetooth drivers
	user space daemon/applications (e.g. NetworkManager, urfkill...)

Then, will platform driver also involve to rfkill control?

We already have rfkill-input in kernel to control rfkill state, if need
more flexible policy control on rfkill key, put policy logic in user
space will be better.
e.g. User can setup rfkill policy by account.


Thanks a lot!
