I managed to find some volunteers with machines that use the GHCI
interface to do some regression testing for me. They aren't exactly
older hardware, all of them with TOS6208 and being made within the last
2 or 3 years. But it's the best I could do.

None of the machines tested showed any regressions as a result of these
patches. I also got testing of using the INFO method to read hotkey
scancodes, and that's working on those machines as well. (I did however
find that I had to reintroduce the global toshiba_acpi pointer for the
i8042 filter, since it doesn't have any mechanism for passing private
data to the callback.)

Any chance of seeing these patches in 3.2?
