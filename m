Those paths are really separate, sysfs_notify_dirent just schedules
a wakeup (it is safe to be called from interrupt context) and does
nothing else. Later on the task will wake up, and likely will
call brightness_show().

Currently we can already have brightness_store() and brightness_show()
race with each other according to a comment in brightness_show()
this is safe, but I've my doubts about this, this means that a
led_classdev's brightness_set and brightness_get method can be
called simultaneously which seems wrong to me / seems to violate
the principle of least surprise where I as a led-driver author
would expect the led-core to protect me against this.

So you're right we need to think about this, but this seems to
be an orthogonal pre-existing problem/race which userspace can
already trigger.

Hmm, looking at the code closer I believe that the led code
needs an audit for races in general. E.g. when sw blinking
led_set_brightness() does a read-modify-write of led_cdev->flags
but led_timer_function() also does read-modify-write of led_cdev->flags
and nothing is protecting led_cdev->flags from these 2 happening at
the same time.

A valid question, after carefully reading the code I see that
triggers and blinking will make brightness_show() / reading
the brightness sysfs attribute return a different value,
so yes you're right we should notify each time one of
__led_set_brightness or __led_set_brightness_blocking
succeeds.

I believe that simply allowing poll on the brightness sysfs
attribute is better.
