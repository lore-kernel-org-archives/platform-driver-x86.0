The hardware is Acer TravelMate 8572, the machine send out key code:
volume up/down, mute, brightness up/down=20
So, the above hotkeys work fine.

But, it send out wmi event for:=20
wifi key (the same with communication key), P key (a special program
key), touchpad, video mode switch.=20

My patch work for translate those wmi event to key code.


Thank's
