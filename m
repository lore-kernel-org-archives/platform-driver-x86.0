Yeah, I was coming to the conclusion that this was probably the best we 
could do. It's unfortunate that "id" is already in use - we'd be able to 
get away without any X server modifications otherwise.

Long term we probably still want to tie serio devices to the ACPI 
devices in case the vendor provides power management calls there, but we 
can leave that until there's an actual example.
