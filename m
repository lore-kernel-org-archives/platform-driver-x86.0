And yet this is a platform with ACPI. I would expect the ACPI to
identify the board, not a custom driver. The newest ACPI spec adds a
lot of nice useful things like GPIO and SPI bindings. Talk to Al Stone
about the progress his team has made on adding GPIO support to ACPICA.

This driver shouldn't be merged into mainline. Keep it as an
out-of-tree patch until the proper solution is implemented. That
shouldn't be too onerous since we now have available not one, but two
mechanisms for describing exactly what you want to do; ACPI or FDT.
