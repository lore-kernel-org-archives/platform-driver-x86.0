Ah, but there is no reason what-so-ever for i being zero. The whole point
of the driver is for cases where i > 1. Or to put it bluntly, anyone
defining a struct i2c_inst_data with zero entries deserves to be punished...

The driver is tiny, I think it's good if there is at least one thing that
can be a little bit interesting :-)

Ahh, good catch, that explains it.
