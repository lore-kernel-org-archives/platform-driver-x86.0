So in case there are two applications in userspace which want to monitor
brightness change and both of those application could change brightness
(via sysfs) then these two applications would not know about every
brightness change and would be out-of-sync of reality what is really
configured by kernel.

This is one part which I did not liked in proposed ABI as it force
userspace to choose and use only one brightness monitoring application
at same time.

Plus if ABI was specified that poll() could be used only for hardware
change (and not by software e.g. kernel/userspace) then such
functionality is not possible to implement for Dell machines. As it
looks like Dell firmware send event about every change of brightness and
we cannot distinguish if change was done by software (kernel) or by
hardware itself.

I do not know now if you already accepted that ABI, I'm just saying that
I do not like it due to requirement for one userspace application as
listener and also because it is not what can be used for Dell machines.

Jacek, was this requirement in ABI already accepted into stable?
