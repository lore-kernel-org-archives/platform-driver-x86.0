Unfortunately, at least the Surface Book (first generation, buttons are
handled the same way as on the Pro 4) has GPIOs defined in MSHW0040, but
they are for different use. Specifically: They can detect if the
clipboard (screen part of the device, the device basically has two parts
that can be separated: clipboard and base) is being removed. Relying on
the GPIOs was my first idea too, but that has been reported to shut down
the Book 1 when the clipboard is detached.

As far as I know, the OEM platform revision check is the easiest way to
differentiate between those devices.

I think I got the -EAGAIN from an outdated LWN article when I first
started working on this, thanks for confirming.

Thank you for this insight, I will update the patch accordingly.
