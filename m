Hm... now I'm thinking... should not be there a generic readonly led=20
trigger named "managed by hw" (or similar name)? Only LED drivers (not=20
userspace) could set it and when set it tells that hw could on its own=20
change level of LED. Not keyboard backlight specific, but generic for=20
led subsystem.

It not this what is needed for keyboard backlight LED drivers?
