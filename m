Agreed.

That is what I was thinking too, waking up userspace poll()
waiters while nothing has changed is not 100% ideal, but
is not a big deal (esp. given the frequency with which this
will happen).

I will do a new version renaming the events / mask to indicate
that they apply to both the thinklight and the keyboard backlight;
and to also notify the thinklight led_classdev of changes
(if it is present).

Note that the led-class changes this relies on are still being
discussed, I will do a new version once that is sorted out.

+1 thank you for testing and for the feedback.
