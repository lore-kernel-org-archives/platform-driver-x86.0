I never said we should drop support of old hardware. I was just
explaining what is Host Notify and saying that it is not incompatible
with lis3lv02d.

How about:

Subject: [PATCH] I2C: add the source of the IRQ in struct i2c_client

With commit 4d5538f5882a ("i2c: use an IRQ to report Host Notify events,
not alert"), the IRQ provided in struct i2c_client might be assigned while
it has not been explicitly declared by either the platform information
or OF or ACPI.
Some drivers (lis3lv02d) rely on the fact that the IRQ gets assigned or
not to trigger a different behavior (exposing /dev/freefall in this case).

Provide a way for others to know who set the IRQ and so they can behave
accordingly.

Dmitry, Wolfram, Jean, would this be acceptable for you?

Sigh. You asked above to not break existing DT bindings, so I don't
understand why you suddenly want to change every bindings by introducing
a change which breaks backward compatibility.

It's not part of the dell patch, but it can be part of the series you
are about to send. Please remember that the current state is that there
is no breakage (only a spurious /dev/freefall which you are not happy
about). The only breakage is with your patch, so it doesn't hurt to have
both sent together so you can control all the requirements at once.
So please incorporate my patch in your series if Wolfram, Jean and Dmitry
agree, and also add the fix in lis3lv02d_i2c to make use of the IRQ source.

Cheers,
Benjamin
