The internal kernel API changes all the time, we are not bound to it be=
yond
ensuring we update the internal users when we change it. I prefer not t=
o
introduce complexity until we have to.

	buffer =3D dell_smbios_get_buffer();
	buffer->input[0] =3D token->location;
	buffer->input[1] =3D token->value;
	dell_smbios_send_request(1, 0);
	dell_smbios_release_buffer();

The get_buffer and release_buffer also include the locking which is nec=
essary
for a shared buffer. If you eliminate the shared buffer, then you have =
to have a
local buffer, which adds back code to create the buffer, initializize
it, free it if it's dynamic, etc.

So from that sense, Micha=C5=82's API seems at least as concise as the =
alternative,
and it introduces less change.
