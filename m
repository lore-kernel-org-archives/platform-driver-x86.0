Sigh. We have a similar situation with acpi_video, which undoubtedly
also affects some other drivers as well.

This is the best I've been able to come up with.

   depends on BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE
   depends on BACKLIGHT_APPLE=n || BACKLIGHT_APPLE
   depends on ACPI_VIDEO=n || ACPI_VIDEO

This at least keeps it from being built-in if it's going to be linking
against symbols provided by a module. I'm definitely open to other
suggestions though.
