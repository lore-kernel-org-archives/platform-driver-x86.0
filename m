Hi,

Thanks you all for your comments, I'll consider them carefully.

I think it could be useful for the user to know what option is available
or not on the board.

I had a look at other drivers, and /sys/devices/platform/ts/ seems to be
a good place to hold those entries (one per options as you suggested).
Do you agree with that?

By the way, as they would be sysfs attributes, is Documentation/ABI the
best place to add the documentation file?
