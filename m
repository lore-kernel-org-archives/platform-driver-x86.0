In this case there are only a limited number of scenarios:

1. The hotkey event gets the mutex before the sysfs write
In this case there is no race as the event is processed before the
sysfs write can be proceed.

2. The sysfs write gets the mutex before the hotkey event:
There are 2 sub scenarios here:

2a) The sysfs writes the same value as the hotkey press just set:
In this case the cached brightness will get updated to this new
value before processing either event can be processed, when both
events get processed they will fail the new_brightness != brightness
check and no event will be generated. Arguably this is a bug but
I believe if the user just set the brightness to the same value,
making the hotkey change a nop that this behavior is fine. The sysfs
write won the race after all, so from a kernel pov it really was
first and the hotkey event really is a nop.

2b) The sysfs write writes a different value then the hotkey,
in this case a question becomes which of the 2 we actually get,
but this is up to the BIOS not up to the kernel, basically this
depends on who won the race from the BIOS pov. If the sysfs
write was seen last from the BIOS pov then our SMM call to get
the current value will report the already cached value for both
events and no events get generated. This make sense since the
hotkey change got cancelled by the sysfs write. If otoh the hotkey
gets handled last, then the first event will read back
a different value, after which an events gets send to userspace
and the cached value gets updated, changing the second event
into a NOP. So in this case things just work as if there was
a significant amount of time between the sysfs write and the
hotkey press.

TL;DR: the very worst then can happen is loosing a hotkey
event because the exact same value was written to sysfs after
the press was handled by the BIOS but before we get to process
the event.

You wrote: "What about just dropping upcoming one event in interval
of next 2-3 second?"

The time window you added makes things more razy. If we just increment
an atomic_t on sysfs_write, and decrement_and_test on an event then
that would be fine and would fix your sysfs write vs hotkey press write
as we would get 2 events in that case.

Correct, that is part of the ABI definition of the brightness_hw_changed
sysfs attribute, we must pass the brightness at the time of the hardware
initiated change.

I really don't like the 2-3 seconds stuff, but I'm fine with going
with your idea of just swallowing one event after a sysfs-write
without the timeout stuff.

I doubt those are notebooks with backlight keyboards, but anyways if
we swallow 1 event per sysfs write we are only doing SMM calls when
actually reporting a change to userspace at which point we need to
make that smm call sooner or later anyways...
