Matthew, can you point me at the license Microsoft is using for the
DBG2 table? I can download the document from Microsoft's site without
seeing any reference to it being licensed only for BIOS implementers.
All I see is a "this document is provided 'as-is', blah blah blah"
blurb at the beginning of the document. It may be that Microsoft has
changed the license on this document in the last 6 months.

I asked some of my contacts at Microsoft about this and was told that
the DBG2 spec was supposed to be freed up; but I wasn't able to get
anything absolutely confirmed or in writing.
