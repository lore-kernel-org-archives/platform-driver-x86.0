Running with it right now, did not help much:

Just for fun, here is what debugfs has to say:

$ ls /sys/kernel/debug/ips/
cpu_clamp  cpu_power  cpu_temp  mch_power  mch_temp
$ cat /sys/kernel/debug/ips/*
23.0W 21.0A
4415mW
46.99
59670mW
0.00

All numbers except the last vary a lot. A few more examples:

21.0W 21.0A
4379mW
51.09
6493mW
0.00

23.0W 21.0A
4681mW
45.13
34062mW
0.00
