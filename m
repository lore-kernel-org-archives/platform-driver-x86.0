In this case I agree with Pavel. While the patches are small enough, fix one
thing each, etc, it isn't clear from the description exactly how these patches
affect users.

If you can articulate how they are "real bugs that bother people" (see
stable_kernel_rules.txt) we can reconsider. I should have pushed for better
commit messages on these it appears as this should be obvious from those, but it
isn't - at least not to me at 8:15am ;-)
