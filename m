Because struct acpi_device things are firmawre objects that shouldn't be
treated as devices.

Yes, in two places to be precise.

Well, I thought we discussed that, but perhaps we didn't.

There's some confusion about what a struct acpi_device is, because sometimes it
is treated as a "companion" of a physical device and sometimes it is treated as
a physical device itself.  This leads to incorrect code as well sometimes,
because ACPI drivers may attempt to bind to things that already have physical
comapnions, for example.

The approach to this I thought we could use, and that we've been using to some
extent already, is to create "physical" companions for all struct acpi_device
objects.  In this particular this "physical companion" is a platform device, so
it needs to be added to the list in acpi_platform.c.  [Otherwise the ACPI PNP
core would create a PNP device for it (unless an ACPI driver is bound to that
struct acpi_device before, but that makes the correctness of the thing depend
on the ordering of driver probing, which is not awesome).]

In this approach device drivers bind to the "physical" devices (platform devices
etc.) instead of struct acpi_device themselves and at least everything is
consistent.

Thanks,
Rafael
