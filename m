Like I said I don't know the details on why NVIDIA isn't affected, Kai
Heng will need to comment here.  You might very well be right.

I stand by my point that the heuristic makes sense for what exists
In the kernel today though.  If the point you mention is the reason
why NV isn't affected and this changes in the future it's a simple extra
|| to match NV cards too, or to remove the AMD part of the check
and just look for Dell subsystem vendor instead of AMD product
vendor and Dell subsystem vendor.
