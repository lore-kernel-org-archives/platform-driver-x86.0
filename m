OK, I got to down to implement this and have a few questions.

The intel_pmc_driver does need some way to determine whether to choose
between spt_reg_map / cnp_reg_map / icl_reg_map. How should it choose
between these?

 1) For ACPI based enumeration, I don't think the ACPI nodes on the
current systems will have anything to offer to help the driver
differentiate between these. So it will still need to choose one of
the above maps based on the CPU model. I assume that is OK. I expect
something like:

        switch (boot_cpu_data.x86_model) {
        case INTEL_FAM6_SKYLAKE_MOBILE:
        case INTEL_FAM6_SKYLAKE_DESKTOP:
        case INTEL_FAM6_KABYLAKE_MOBILE:
        case INTEL_FAM6_KABYLAKE_DESKTOP:
                pmcdev->map =3D &spt_reg_map;
                break;

        case INTEL_FAM6_CANONLAKE_DESKTOP:
                pmcdev->map =3D &cnp_reg_map;
                break;

        case INTEL_FAM6_ICELAKE_DESKTOP:
                pmcdev->map =3D &icl_reg_map;
                break;
        default:
                /* Which map should we use by default? */
        }


 2) For the ACPI based enumeration, what should be the default map
chosen by the driver, for CPUs other than what is in that list today
(Or do we expect to keep adding to this switch/case for new CPU
models)?

3) For the fallback option, i.e. manually creating platform devices
using a new file, yes, we can pass a value in platform_data to
indicate which map to choose from, which is what I think should be
done. However, I am wondering if all this fallback might be an
overkill / over engineering. Do we know of any platforms that do not
have this ACPI device, and still are actually using this
intel_pmc_core driver? If not, may be we don't need this fallback
option?

Thanks,
