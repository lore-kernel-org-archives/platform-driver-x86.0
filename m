No, the DRM drivers don't filter ExpressCard-attached GPUs when
registering with vga_switcheroo.  They do filter Thunderbolt-
attached GPUs.

The ExpressCard 2.0 spec defines some ACPI stuff that *might* be
used to recognize root ports that are ExpressCard slots, but I'm
not sure how reliable that is.  I don't have such a machine and
have no experience with it.

This is from the MacBookPro8,3 DSDT:

            Device (RP04)
            {
                Name (_ADR, 0x001C0003)
                OperationRegion (A1E0, PCI_Config, 0x19, 0x01)
                Field (A1E0, ByteAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
                {
                    SECB,   8
                }

                Device (EXCD)
                {
                    Name (_ADR, 0x00)
                    Name (_SUN, 0x01)
                    Method (_RMV, 0, NotSerialized)
                    {
                        Return (0x01)
                    }

                    Name (_EJD, "\\_SB.PCI0.EHC2.HUBN.PRTN.PRT4")
                }
                ...
            }

Thanks,

Lukas
