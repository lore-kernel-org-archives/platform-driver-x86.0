=3D Testing =3D

I tested six Dell systems for two sets of patches for dell radio
button - two system with radio slider and four with radio hotkey.
There are also two systems with working ARBT method.

=3D=3D Basic Information =3D=3D
Based OS: Ubuntu 14.10 (kernel 3.16 [1]) and kernel 3.18 [2]

Patches:
1. dell-wireless v3 =3D original v2 + Gabriele's suggestion [3]
2. dell-rbtn [4]

Method:
1. run "rfkill list" and press hotkey / toggle slider during runtime
2. run "rfkill list" and toggle slider during S3

=3D=3D Results =3D=3D

I summarized the tests in Google sheet as below. Please advise if
anyone has problem reading it.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1voffS6dNglwAExSGh3UmG__UAO2qfZ8=
29CkJLPo06aI/edit?usp=3Dsharing

PS. The document will stay as long as possible for future references.

=3D=3D Summary =3D=3D

1. I did not observed a duplicated event. However, keycode 240
(unknown) is generated on many UUT. It is not issued by dell-laptop or
del-wmi. I am suspecting it is the other event Pali observes but it
can be the result of different distro.

2. Some system issues scancode "0xe0 0x73 0xe0 0xf3". It can also be
used toggle wireless state but this can also be distro-dependent. This
scancode does nothing on Ubuntu 14.10.

2. There are two systems with working ARBT (XPS 13 9333 and Inspiron
7447). Calling ARBT(1) changes BIOS behaviours, and this matches to
Dell's document. We should include it in the patch for maximum
capability.


[1] dell-wireless is only tested 3.16.
[2] dell-rbtn is tested on 3.16 and 3.18, but no differences are observ=
