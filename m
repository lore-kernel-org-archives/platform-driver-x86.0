Hi Marco,

It was used in the original installation, I often got "turned off
HDD due to ....", but I had to reinstall and used a new W7, and I am
very lazy in hunting down drivers for W7 since I hardly use it.
I will check what I see in the device manager of W7.

Yeah, please do so.

So HSC0 returns similar data to HSC1.

No idea!

That would be nice!!!! I am indeed searching for a way to activate HDMI
output on my laptop, but didn't manage till now.

Can you provide me with a patch so that I can test these things? I mean
I can simply switch the position and read values from /sys files.

Hmm, in the patch relative to your to turn on/off the nvidia device
we use this paths. If you are interested I can send you the patch
I am currently working with, relative to 3.0.0-rc7+your patch
.

No. It seems that the video driver (intel) does *not* turn off the 
nvidia card. I I load it without special action I get an active
nvidia card that eats battery time.

I am fine with testing many things ... but my actual knowledge of ACPI
internals is minimal, sorry.

Best wishes
