I have heard already such excuses. Let's consider this as a "Last
Chinese Warning".

So, we consider reviewing applying *already floating around* patches
in exchange to looking forward for clean up next.
Do we have a deal?

Before you are going to implement anything in the code, please, share
a document (architectural point of view) how you would see things
should be done.
Also consider to address PMC (Atom drivers) and P-Unit drivers which
are related to SCU / IPC to have some structure.
