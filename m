This patch series moves the dell-led driver from the LED subsystem to
the x86 platform driver subsystem.

The original motivation behind this effort was to move all code using
the dell-smbios module to the x86 platform driver subsystem.  While I
was investigating the possibilities to do that, it quickly emerged that
dell-led can and in fact should be moved to the x86 platform driver
subsystem in its entirety.

dell-led consists of two major parts:

  - the part exposing a microphone mute LED interface, introduced in
    db6d8cc00773 ("dell-led: add mic mute led interface"); this
    interface is used by sound/pci/hda/dell_wmi_helper.c; while the
    original implementation used a WMI interface, it was changed to use
    dell-smbios in cf0d7ea33596 ("dell-led: use dell_smbios_find_token()
    for finding mic DMI tokens") and 0c41a08e131d ("dell-led: use
    dell_smbios_send_request() for performing SMBIOS calls"),

  - the part handling an activity LED present in Dell Latitude 2100
    netbooks, introduced in 72dcd8d08aca ("leds: Add Dell Business Class
    Netbook LED driver"); it binds to a specific WMI GUID and then
    registers a LED device which is controlled using WMI (i.e. it is
    essentially a WMI driver).

Patches 1 and 2 clean up the microphone mute LED interface to minimize
the amount of code moved around.

Patch 3 updates a variable name in sound/pci/hda/dell_wmi_helper.c so
that it better matches that variable's role.

Patch 4 moves the microphone mute LED interface to
drivers/platform/x86/dell-laptop.c, effectively causing
sound/pci/hda/dell_wmi_helper.c to depend on CONFIG_DELL_LAPTOP instead
of CONFIG_LEDS_DELL_NETBOOKS.

Patch 5 reverts dell-led to the state it was in after its initial commit
72dcd8d08aca ("leds: Add Dell Business Class Netbook LED driver") by
removing all remnants of the microphone mute LED handling code.

Patch 6 moves all that is left of dell-led (i.e. the activity LED part,
as originally implemented), to a new module which is placed in
drivers/platform/x86/dell-wmi-led.c.

Patch 7 fixes coding style issues in drivers/platform/x86/dell-wmi-led.c
to make sure it gets a clean start in the x86 platform driver subsystem.

As all patches except patch 3 in this series affect the LED subsystem,
the series is based on linux-leds/for-next.

Changes from v2:

  - Add patch 7 fixing coding style issues (feedback from Joe and Andy
    taken into account).

  - Add leading zero to constants in patch 4.

  - Move dell-led.h include one line higher in patch 4.

Changes from v1:

  - Squash patches 2-4 from v1 into a single patch (#2 in v2).

  - Add patch 3.

  - Fix subject pattern in patch 4.

  - Slight commit message adjustments, including fixing a typo
    ("COFIG_LEDS_DELL_NETBOOKS") in patch 6.

  - Remove the name of the module's source file from the header comment
    in drivers/platform/x86/dell-wmi-led.c to avoid the need to update
    it in the future.
