Another one for Asus N90Sc which was booting fine with 10.04
but fails to boot with 10.10:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/653626

Seen that the issue mostly happens on Asus boxes, it's possible
that their firmwares are buggy but they were booting/shutting down
correctly until a recent change in kernel.
