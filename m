But dell_smbios_register_notifier() name is totally confusing. It does
not register any notifier for SMBIOS. Nor it have nothing common with
SMBIOS API.

Also there is absolutely no need that dell-rbtn.ko needs to depends on
dell-smbios.ko. dell-rbtn.ko is ACPI driver which does not use any of
SMBIOS API.

Right now I'm not saying what is the best place for that notifier (as I
still do not have ideal candidate). I'm just saying that notifier is not
part of SMBIOS API and therefore dell-smbios.ko is not right place for
it.

So currently we have these different APIs for dell notebook drivers:
* ACPI (used in dell-rbtn.ko and dell-smo8800.ko)
* WMI (used in dell-wmi.ko, dell-wmi-aio.ko, dell-led.ko)
* SMBIOS (used in dell-laptop.ko, dell-wmi.ko and dell-led.ko)
* some other platform code (used in dell-laptop.ko)

And now notifier is needed for drivers:
* dell-laptop.ko
* dell-wmi.ko
* dell-rbtn.ko

And if I look at above two sets, none of above drivers is good candidate
for central notifier functions... Maybe we should really introduce new
separate file where will central dell notifier live?
