That's weird!
Because acer-wmi driver only maintain the killswitch on by itself and
will not touch hci driver's killswitch. I don't know why hci's
killswitch initial state is 0, need to check hci driver and rfkill
staff.

Could you please share your bluetooth device to us?
Please send out "lsusb" result when bluetooth device available.


Thank's a lot!
