I am 50/50 here. On one hand selecting whole subsystems may not be the
best option, on the other hand (depending on how Kconfig is organized)
it might make sense. Consider you have an USB joystick. You are in
input, in joystick sub-menu, which comes _before_ USB. If you happen to
have USB disabled then you, with your scheme, will not see the entry for
the joystick. You will have to go into USB menu, activate USB and then
go back and scan menus that you already been to for any new options. And
again, and again. Not very friendly and so right now USB input devices
do depend on INPUT, select USB and depend on USB_ARCH_HAS_HCD (to make
sure USB can be activated).

Also, in case of CMPC, the user wants to support _all_ features of
his/her laptop which is kind of useless without input, right?
