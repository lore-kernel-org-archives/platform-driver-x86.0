I have never personally experienced this, only received reports which
indicated this and that the change (as well as manually reloading
soc_button_array) fixed it. I will come back to you if I hear anything
in regards to this again.

I have now also tested your patch on the Surface Book 2. Does not cause
any issues as far as I can tell.
