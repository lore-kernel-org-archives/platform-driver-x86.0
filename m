No, because in this case we would not use "airplane" as a suffix for a
LED associated with an individual radio.

The problem here is that the "rfkill" name is already associated with
individual rfkill switches under /sys/class/rfkill,
/sys/devices/platform/*/rfkill etc, so I think we're better off
distinguishing "airplane" vs "wifi" vs "bluetooth" etc, to avoid
confusion.
