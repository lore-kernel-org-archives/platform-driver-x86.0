Sort of.

dell-laptop and msi-laptop are content to take some action on the keys
they see but still leave the keys in the input stream, so their job is
a bit easier.

I need to swallow one kind of extended key, detect and not swallow two
others, and ignore all the ones that are normal keys.  But that means
that I don't know whether I should filter out 0xe0 until it's too
late.

So either I'd need a function to feed an event back into i8042 or I
need to filter a little farther downstream when the keys are resolved
into keycodes (or scancodes -- I'm not really up on the terminology).
