What about -ENOSYS for -2?

Ok, I will add comment.

Ok, I will move it into two static inline functions (one for=20
kbd_get_info and second for kbd_tokens).

Ok. I'm not native English speaker and I did not understand what=20
"Decreasing line lenth" means...

Err... to seconds :-) But OK, I will change comment.
