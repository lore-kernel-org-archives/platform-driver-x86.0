I've added this series to my queue for 3.13.

Since the next step will be to introduce a list of systems that need
video.use_native_backlight=1 *and* don't break in that configuration, I don't
see much point adding another Kconfig option for the default.

Hopefully, in the future we'll be able to fix the problems causing
video.use_native_backlight=1 to fail of the systems where it fails and then
we'll be able to make that the default behavior and drop the option altogether.

Thanks!
