Yeah, at least on TOS1900 devices, all write calls set the out[n] to zero,
and then assign the specified return status to out[0] (either success or error).

Yeah, since TOS1900 set all out[n] values to zero, I was expecting that same
behaviour from a TOS62XX device, however, bug 86521 proved me wrong.

For TOS1900 devices, they are, but for TOS62XX, that's another story,
the methods
are hidden and I can't see what they're doing... :-(

We're doing it already, toshiba_acpi_setup_backlight checks for read and write
support in order to register the backlight, and since all* TOS1900
support it read-only
they all get bailed out by these checks, except those badly behaved models,
they simply return SUCCESS and thus pass that check, creating a broken backlight
device with just read capabilities.

* (Actually there are two TOS1900 devices, the ones that support it
read only, and the
ones that don't support it at all)

Yeah, I thought that from the beginning, but I found that a bit
cumbersome to add
those models to the growing list, if we can do it in-house. But I'm
fine with whatever
decision is made here.
