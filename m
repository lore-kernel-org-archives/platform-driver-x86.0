Ah, right, sorry forgot to comment it in LKML.

There is another open. If I grep through the kernel tree I see SPDX
headers that are decorated both with C99- and C89-style comments. I
guess I ended up using C99-style because when I was instructed to add
SPDX headers in the first place that was the example I was given. Still
checkpatch.pl complains about C99-style comments.

Which one is right and why the kernel tree is polluted with C99-headers
when they do not pass checkpatch.pl? How those commits were ever
accepted?
