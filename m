Have you closely looked at the patch? It only applies to this bit of
thinkpad-acpi code:

         /* Do not issue duplicate brightness change events to
          * userspace. tpacpi_detect_brightness_capabilities() must have
          * been called before this point  */
         if (acpi_video_handles_brightness_key_presses()) {
                 pr_info("This ThinkPad has standard ACPI backlight "
                         "brightness control, supported by the ACPI "
                         "video driver\n");
                 pr_notice("Disabling thinkpad-acpi brightness events "
                           "by default...\n");

                 /* Disable brightness up/down on Lenovo thinkpads when
                  * ACPI is handling them, otherwise it is plain impossible
                  * for userspace to do something even remotely sane */
                 hotkey_reserved_mask |=
                         (1 << TP_ACPI_HOTKEYSCAN_FNHOME)
                         | (1 << TP_ACPI_HOTKEYSCAN_FNEND);
                 hotkey_unmap(TP_ACPI_HOTKEYSCAN_FNHOME);
                 hotkey_unmap(TP_ACPI_HOTKEYSCAN_FNEND);
         }

So it only disables hotkey press reporting, not to the thinkpad_acpi
backlight handling code, that still is using acpi_video_get_backlight_type()  :

         if (acpi_video_get_backlight_type() != acpi_backlight_vendor) {
                 if (brightness_enable > 1) {
                         pr_info("Standard ACPI backlight interface "
                                 "available, not loading native one\n");
                         return 1;
                 } else if (brightness_enable == 1) {
                         pr_warn("Cannot enable backlight brightness support, "
                                 "ACPI is already handling it.  Refer to the "
                                 "acpi_backlight kernel parameter.\n");
                         return 1;
                 }
         } else if (tp_features.bright_acpimode && brightness_enable > 1) {
                 pr_notice("Standard ACPI backlight interface not "
                           "available, thinkpad_acpi native "
                           "brightness control enabled\n");
         }

When the new video.report_key_events kernel cmdline option gets manually set to
a non default value then yes it may report false while acpi-video is attached
to the backlight class. By default, no it will never return false when acpi-video
is attached to the backlight class.

This should not matter though, as said this new function is only used to suppress
the reporting of key-presses. I realize that doing so will also cause
tpacpi_driver_event() to get called on brightness hotkey presses, but that has:

         if (ibm_backlight_device) {
                 switch (hkey_event) {
                 case TP_HKEY_EV_BRGHT_UP:
                 case TP_HKEY_EV_BRGHT_DOWN:
                         tpacpi_brightness_notify_change();
                 }
         }

And the creating of ibm_backlight_device is still protected by

if (acpi_video_get_backlight_type() != acpi_backlight_vendor) return 1;

So this new check really does nothing other then NOT suppress the hotkey presses
reported by thinkpad-acpi when for some reason a user has asked acpi-video to
suppress its reporting of hotkey presses, which is exactly what it should do.

IMHO this only shows that having a separate function to detect if acpi-video
is reporting keypresses is the right thing to do.

Hans
