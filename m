So if I interpret that correctly, we're dropping the last patch
(ENODEV -> ENXIO) from the series? That's fine by me. As mentioned
earlier, I already saw something else break because I returned ENXIO
instead of ENODEV.

Maybe it's a good idea to try and document the expected behavior
somewhere, if even Greg isn't sure what to do.
