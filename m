I have only now noticed that I phrased the commit message for this patc=
h
rather unfortunately as it inappropriately conveyed my reasoning.  What
I meant by "the buffer passed as input" was not "the buffer passed as a=
n
argument to dell_smbios_send_request()", but rather "the buffer passed
to the SMI handler".  In other words, there is no reason to return a
buffer from dell_smbios_send_request(), because each caller will simply
find their output in the same buffer they used to provide input (no
matter whether the latter is passed as a function argument or accessed
using a module-wide variable).

Anyway, as even the above explanation is hardly a stellar demonstration
of clarity, I believe your idea of resolving this issue may simply be
the best one, thanks.
