I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated. The register set doesn't
seem to be linear. I have absolutely no idea what the undocumented
registers do. For the sake of security, I would hate to see them
accessible from userland.

Okay, but then again I'd need to pass this from the board
driver into the gpio driver. Feels much easier and safer to
just pass the registers.

What I perhaps could do: add all documented registers as gpio's
in the gpio driver and make the board driver a dummy consumer
for the unused ones.

According to my information, it is the hardware who dictates that
non-linear layout. Even the PIN naming is non-linear. And I don't
like to see this passed to upper layers, or even userland. So,
at least the gpio driver should only serve the documented gpios
and present them lineary.

Maybe the holes in the register set are technically also gpios,
but used by some internal logic and not properly masked out in
hw - really weird things (possibly damage) could happen.

Can't speak about standard ICs/SoCs, but i've seen such things
in some of my client's fpga designs. For example incomplete
decoders, gpios attached to internal state machines, etc, etc
So, I've learned to be *very* cautious with undocumented registers.
