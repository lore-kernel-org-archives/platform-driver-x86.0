Hi Rafael,

thanks a lot for your patience.

There are 4 users of acpi_dev_present in linux-next (3 in sound/soc/intel/,
1 in include/linux/apple-gmux.h). I expect 1 other user to appear in i915.

I've created a patch (based on linux-next and included below as an RFC)
to rename acpi_dev_present to acpi_dev_found in the function declaration
as well as at all call sites. I've also rebased the 2 pdx86 patches onto
this and pushed the branch to GitHub:
https://github.com/l1k/linux/commits/acpi_dev_found

My plan is currently to wait until all users are merged into 4.6,
then rebase my branch onto Linus' tree and post the resulting patches.
This will be either late during the 4.6 merge window or immediately
after it has closed. You could then either pick up the patches for
4.6 or 4.7, whichever you prefer.

If you'd prefer a different way of moving forward or would like
something changed in the patch below, please let me know and
I will be happy to adjust accordingly.

Thanks again,

Lukas

Subject: [RFC] ACPI / utils: Rename acpi_dev_present()

acpi_dev_present() was originally named after pci_dev_present()
to signify the similarity of the two functions.

However Rafael J. Wysocki pointed out that the exported function
acpi_dev_present() is easily confused with the non-exported
acpi_device_is_present(). Additionally in ACPI parlance the term
"present" usually refers to the "device is present" bit returned
by the _STA control method, yet acpi_dev_present() merely checks
presence in the namespace. It does not invoke _STA at all, let
alone check the "device is present" bit.

As suggested by Rafael, rename the function to acpi_dev_found()
and adjust all existing call sites.
