Comments, please.

OK, cool.

That's good background fodder for the changelog.

But, for the comment, I'm happy with something like this:

	/*
	 * The fault resulted from violation of SGX-specific access-
	 * controls.  This is expected to be the result of some lower
	 * layer action (CPU suspend/resume, VM migration) and is
	 * not related to anything the OS did.  Treat it as an access
	 * error to ensure it is passed up to the app via a signal where
	 * it can be handled.
	 */

I really don't think we need to delve too deeply into the relationship
between EPCM and PTEs or anything.  Let's just say, "it's not the
kernel's fault, it's not the app's fault, so throw up our hands".
