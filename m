Which basically means that new WMI /dev/ files does not help for Dell.

Kernel needs to manipulate with SMBIOS for implementing rfkill, keyboard
backlight, display brightness and also needs to receive WMI events for
hotkeys. So kernel modules would lock WMI interface for receiving events
& sending SMBIOS calls, and userspace would be blocked from usage of
this WMI GUID.

I do not think that we can solve this problem easily in vendor-neutral
interface. There was argument that WMI API was designed to allow
userspace applications call firmware functions directly... But we are
using WMI in kernel and we should not allow both kernel and userspace to
fight on some WMI API.

So for Dell we need for sure some Dell specific interface which covers
all needed functionality. I'm not sure what everything Dell software
needs, so what about specifying current usage of Dell SMBIOS/WMI
functions from existing userspace applications and also planned usage in
future? Then from this information we can design kernel and userspace
API which can fit for Dell usage.

About other vendor WMI's functions... I'm not sure, but there is again
possibility that rfkill, leds or hotkeys would exists on same WMI GUID
as other maintenance functions (which userspace wants), so export would
be again blocked by kernel module for rfkill/leds/hotkeys.

Therefore I'm not really sure if some /dev/wmi* API would be usefull,
and not always blocked by kernel module which implements rfkill support.
