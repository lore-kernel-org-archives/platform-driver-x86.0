OK, but shouldn't the wakeup usually be handled by ACPI?
Clearly I don't understand this.  I mean on the non-ACPI
embedded ARM systems I'm used to I need to enable specific
irqs as wakeup sources, but on ACPI, isn't SCI the implicit
wakeup irq?  Probably I'm just totally confused, so let
me ask another way, below.

That would be great!


I found in the DSDT:

    Scope (_SB.GPO0)
    {
        Name (EVBF, Buffer (0x03) {})
        CreateByteField (EVBF, Zero, EVST)
        CreateByteField (EVBF, One, ELEN)
        CreateByteField (EVBF, 0x02, ENVT)
        Name (LIDZ, One)
        Method (_E4E, 0, Serialized)  // _Exx: Edge-Triggered GPE
        {
            Name (_T_0, Zero)  // _T_x: Emitted by ASL Compiler
            If (^^PCI0.I2C1.AVBL != One)
            {
                Return (Zero)
            }

            EVBF = ^^PCI0.I2C1.ENID /* \_SB_.PCI0.I2C1.ENID */
...
            _T_0 = ENVT /* \_SB_.GPO0.ENVT */
...
                ElseIf (_T_0 == 0xA9)
                {
                    Notify (PWRB, 0x80) // Status Change
                    Break
                }

and
        Device (GPO0)
        {
...
            Method (_AEI, 0, NotSerialized)  // _AEI: ACPI Event Interrupts
            {
                Name (WBUF, ResourceTemplate ()
                {
                    GpioInt (Edge, ActiveLow, ExclusiveAndWake, PullUp, 0x0000,
                        "\\_SB.GPO0", 0x00, ResourceConsumer, ,
                        )
                        {   // Pin list
                            0x004E
                        }
                })
                If (OSID == One)
                {
                    Return (WBUF) /* \_SB_.GPO0._AEI.WBUF */
                }
            }

and OSID is a field in 
    OperationRegion (GNVS, SystemMemory, 0x7A158000, 0x0362)
which is inside what /proc/iomem lists as "ACPI no-volatile storage".
OSID is read a lot in the DSDT but never written to.
But calling \_SB.GPO0._AEI in acpidbg returns a buffer of size 25.

Now my question is, is this pin 0x004E the same as this
in /proc/interrupts which fires on LID event?

 158:          2          0          0          0  chv-gpio   43 ACPI:Event



The FADT has
            Control Method Power Button (V1) : 0
            Control Method Sleep Button (V1) : 1

PWRBTN_EN in PM1 is set.  But PWRBTN press causes thermal irq.

No SCI (irq 9) is ever generated, except by writing to the
BIOS_RLS bit in SMI_EN register (IO port 0x430).

GPE block addresses in FADT are 0.  GPE0a_EN register (IO 0x428)
is set to 0x6000 (TCO_EN + PME_B0_EN, but none of the GPIO enables).

Any advice how to continue?


Thanks,
Johannes
