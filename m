If I do not set acpi_backlight=3Dvendor and then change brightness by
writing to above /sys/* link this is same behaviour I see as well.  If
I use Fn-F5 and Fn-F6, I do not see the issue (brightness increments
linearly).  I believe thats because events are not sent to
/dev/input/event* and so software (gnome-power-manager) is never
notified and won't wrote to /sys/*.  If I launch power manager
preferences and change brightness then I do see issue.

In this case, I'm using Fedora 13 beta's kernel 2.6.33.2-41.

Yesterday, I was running 0901 and today I'm running 1003.  Same
behaviour in both cases.
