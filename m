Hum, for screen brightness, try to start without any desktop
environment on a laptop where the keys don't control the BIOS and only
send input events, and you won't be able to change the screen
brightness.

This is actually worse for keyboard backlight since only gnome support =
it.

Probably only a module parameter. And disabled by default.

Yeah rfkill was just an example, of such interaction, but your right
rfkill support is currently pretty good.
