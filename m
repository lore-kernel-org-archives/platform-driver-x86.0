Pass. I really have no opinion on the above, as long as we pick something and 
stick with it (i.e. not-another-rfkill-rewrite).

As an aside, just because Windows does something is not a good reason to do it 
or expose on on Linux if it doesn't make any sense.

When did Acer laptops start doing this then? The behaviour they always did in 
the past was that pressing the wireless/ bluetooth/ 3G button sent out a 
scancode, and is was then the job of something else to catch that (be it 
rfkill-input or friends) and for that something else to then toggle the state.

Do the current batch of laptops then just 'magically' toggle the state without 
needing rfkill-input?

(And do you actually have contact with someone on the Acer BIOS team? Because 
I've never managed to get through to anyone at Acer, so would be interested to 
know).

Well, my point is more that we should figure out what we want, and then stick 
with that. I don't want to add a pointless module paramater that all of three 
people are ever going to use, and then have to support it working both ways.
