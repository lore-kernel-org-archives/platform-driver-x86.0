My ASUS PU551LD laptop has a problem with its fan state when resuming from S3. 
In particular, the fan goes to full speed a second or two after waking up and 
cannot be reset without turning off the laptop. For example, rebooting to 
Windows and doing a suspend/resume cycle while the fan is in bad state will 
not reset it. I have observed this behavior with all kernel versions I have 
used on this laptop (oldest being 3.16, newest 4.1-rc5).

sensors(1) does not show any fans, but asus-nb-wmi exposes 
/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/pwm1, which shows values like 85 during normal 
operation but goes to the expected 255 when the fan is running at full speed 
after waking up from S3.

Not being a kernel dev (but knowing C), what can I do to help fix this issue?
