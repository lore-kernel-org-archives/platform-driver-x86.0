Doesn't hardware always have this problem over time?

Definitely should be refined.

Meltdowns approach AFAIK does not work because reads outside the enclave
will always have a predefined value (-1) but only if the page is present,
which was later exploited in the Foreshadow attack.

512-bit blocks and merkle tree based mac. It is pretty well documented
in https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/204.pdf. I'll take not to myself to add
this to the references.

Thanks for the feedback. The ocumentation is hard to drive forward w/o it.
