There's an accelerometer driver (the one I referenced as submitted by
Andy Ross), but it only works in polling mode (input-polled). With this
event, userspace doesn't have to use this polled device until orientation
changes, hence saving CPU, power, etc.

See http://www.spinics.net/lists/platform-driver-x86/msg01682.html for
the patches.
