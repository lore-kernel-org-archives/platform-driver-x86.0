Well, recently hardware had some problems keeping its
promises. So... what about rowhammer, meltdown and spectre?

Which ones apply, which ones do not, and on what cpu generations?

Encryption, that sounds nice, but it is hard to do right. If SGX
protected code changes single bit in its memory, how many bits will be
changed in physical RAM?

Can we get security people to look at this and perhaps tells us what
properties it has?
